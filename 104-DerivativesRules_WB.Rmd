# Derivative Rules - Workbook

## Learning Objectives — Derivative Rules

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

1. **Read mathematical expressions as instructions** and decompose a function into sums, constants, powers, products, quotients, and compositions.  
2. **Apply basic rules** — constant, power, constant multiple, sum/difference, \( e^x \), \( \ln x \), \( \sin x \), \( \cos x \) — to differentiate common terms without reverting to limits.  
3. **Use the product, quotient, and chain rules** to differentiate functions built from multiple changing parts, showing clear intermediate steps and correct notation.  
4. **Select the right rule(s)** for a given function by identifying its top-level structure and any nested “inside–outside” relationships.  
5. **Interpret derivatives in context**, explaining what a computed rate of change means for an environmental quantity (e.g., pollutant concentration, biomass, streamflow).  
6. **Check and simplify results**, factoring, combining like terms, and performing quick reasonableness checks (units, signs, limiting behavior).  
7. **Communicate with multiple notations** — prime, Leibniz, and operator — and translate between them accurately.  
8. **Diagnose common errors**, such as forgetting the inner derivative or misusing product vs. chain rule, and correct them using structured reasoning or unit checks.  

---

**Success looks like:**  
Given a new environmental model, you can:

- Identify which derivative rules apply,  
- Compute \( f'(x) \) cleanly, and  
- Explain in words what that derivative tells you about how the system is changing.

## Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Derivative of a Constant

Not all functions *change*. A constant function is perfectly flat — no growth, no decline, no change over time or space.  

The derivative gives us a way to *prove* that this lack of change equals a slope of zero.

---

### Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud

::: promptbox
**Prompt:**  
Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is telling you to do:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0
\]

| Symbol / Term | What It Tells You To Do |
|:---------------|:------------------------|
| \( \frac{d}{dx} \) | |
| \( c \) | |
| \( = 0 \) | |

---

### Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe

::: promptbox
**Activity:**  
In your own words, describe what the rule for a constant tells you to do.

1. Recognize that the function’s value **never changes** — it’s constant for all \( x \).  
2. The “rate of change” or “slope” is therefore **zero everywhere**.  
3. When you apply the derivative operator \( \frac{d}{dx} \), the output is \( 0 \).

Now apply this to three examples:

| Function \( f(x) \) | What It Represents | Derivative \( f'(x) \) |
|:--------------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| \( f(x) = 7 \) | Constant value | |
| \( f(x) = -12 \) | Constant offset | |
| \( f(x) = 3.14 \) | Physical constant | |

### Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Limit Definition

We can confirm this result directly from the **limit definition of a derivative**:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\]

If \( f(x) = c \) (a constant), then:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c - c}{h} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0}{h} = 0
\]

Because the numerator is always zero, the slope — the rate of change — is zero everywhere.

> In words: “When nothing changes, the rate of change is zero.”

---

### Step 4: Apply to Environmental Contexts

::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
For each situation, identify whether the derivative (rate of change) would be zero or nonzero.

| Scenario | Description | Is the Derivative Zero? | Why? |
|:----------|:-------------|:-----------------------:|:-----|
| A lake’s surface area remains 10 km² for 10 years | | | |
| Atmospheric CO₂ remains steady at 420 ppm for one month | | | |
| Soil temperature remains constant throughout the day | | | |

Now write one more *realistic* example where a quantity stays constant in your field (e.g., hydrology, forestry, marine science).

## Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Power Rule

Mathematics is a language of instructions.  
When you see a formula like the **Power Rule**, you’re not just seeing symbols — you’re seeing a *procedure* that tells you *what to do* and *how each step transforms the function*.

---

### Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud

::: promptbox
**Prompt:**  
Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is asking you to do:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\big(x^n\big) = n x^{n-1}
\]

| Symbol / Term | What It Tells You To Do |
|:---------------|:------------------------|
| \( \frac{d}{dx} \) | |
| \( x^n \) | |
| \( n \) | |
| \( x^{n-1} \) | |

**Notes:**

### Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe

::: promptbox
**Activity (Think–Pair–Share):**  
In your own words, write the **recipe** the Power Rule gives you for differentiating \( x^n \):

1. Look at the exponent \( n \).  
2. Multiply the whole expression by that exponent.  
3. Subtract one from the exponent.  
4. Keep the base \( x \) the same.  

Now apply this recipe to three quick examples:

| Function \( f(x) \) | Your Steps | Derivative \( f'(x) \) |
|:--------------------:|:-----------|:-----------------------:|
| \( x^2 \) | | |
| \( x^5 \) | | |
| \( x^{-3} \) | | |

**Notes:**  
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
:::

---

### Step 3: Deriving the Power Rule from the Limit Definition

Let’s see how the Power Rule comes directly from the **limit definition of a derivative**.

We start with:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{(x+h)^n - x^n}{h}
\]

We expand \((x+h)^n\) using the **Binomial Theorem**:

\[
(x + h)^n = x^n + n x^{n-1}h + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \cdots + h^n
\]

Substitute this expansion into the limit expression:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} 
\frac{\big(x^n + n x^{n-1}h + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \cdots + h^n\big) - x^n}{h}
\]

Simplify the numerator — the \(x^n\) terms cancel:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} 
\frac{n x^{n-1}h + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 + \cdots + h^n}{h}
\]

Now factor out \(h\):

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} 
\Big( n x^{n-1} + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h + \cdots + h^{n-1} \Big)
\]

As \(h \to 0\), all terms containing \(h\) vanish, leaving only:

\[
\boxed{f'(x) = n x^{n-1}}
\]

That’s the **Power Rule** — it’s the simplified result of the limit definition.

---

### Step 4: Apply the Instructions to a Real Example

::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Let \( f(x) = x^4 \).

1. Identify the base and exponent.  
2. Apply the Power Rule as a set of instructions.  
3. Simplify your result.  
4. Interpret your answer: what does \( f'(x) \) *mean* if \(f(x)\) represents biomass growth rate over time?

## Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Constant Multiplier Rule

The **Constant Multiplier Rule** tells us how constants behave when we take derivatives.  
It’s the mathematical version of saying: “Scaling a process doesn’t change *how fast* it changes — only *by how much*.”

---

### Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud

::: promptbox
**Prompt:**  
Read this equation aloud and explain what each part is telling you to do:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\big[c \cdot f(x)\big] = c \cdot f'(x) = c \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\big[f(x)\big]
\]

| Symbol / Term | What It Tells You To Do |
|:---------------|:------------------------|
| \( c \) | |
| \( f(x) \) | |
| \( f'(x) \) | |
| \( c \cdot f'(x) \) | |

**Notes:**  
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
:::

---

### Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe

::: promptbox
**Activity (Think–Pair–Share):**  
Describe the **procedure** this rule gives you in plain English.

1. Identify the constant \( c \).  
2. Differentiate the variable part \( f(x) \) as usual.  
3. Keep the constant \( c \) in front — it “comes along for the ride.”  
4. Multiply \( c \) by the derivative \( f'(x) \).

Now apply this recipe to three examples:

| Function \( f(x) \) | Constant \( c \) | Derivative \( f'(x) \) |
|:--------------------:|:----------------:|:-----------------------:|
| \( 5x^3 \) |  | |
| \( -2x^4 \) |  | |
| \( 7 \) |  | |

**Notes:**  
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
:::

---

### Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Limit Definition

We can prove the rule using the **limit definition of a derivative**:

\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\]

For a constant multiple \( g(x) = c \cdot f(x) \):

\[
g'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{c \cdot f(x+h) - c \cdot f(x)}{h}
\]

Factor out the constant \( c \):

\[
g'(x) = c \cdot \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\]

Recognize that the remaining limit is just \( f'(x) \):

\[
\boxed{g'(x) = c \cdot f'(x)}
\]

That’s the **Constant Multiplier Rule** — the constant stays the same, while the variable part changes according to its own derivative.

---

### Step 4: Apply the Instructions to a Real Example

::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Let \( f(x) = x^2 \), and define \( g(x) = 3f(x)\).

1. Identify the constant multiplier \( c \).  
2. Use the Power Rule to find \( f'(x) \).  
3. Apply the Constant Multiplier Rule.  
4. Simplify the result.



**Interpretation:**  
If \( f(x) \) describes tree height over time, multiplying by 3 simply scales the entire process — the *rate of growth* is three times faster, but the shape of the change is identical.

## Activity: Reading Math as Instructions — The Sum and Difference Rules

When we add or subtract functions, each one still changes according to its own rule.  
The **Sum and Difference Rules** tell us that differentiation distributes over addition and subtraction —  
you can take the derivative of each part *separately* and then combine the results.

---

### Step 1: Read the Expression Aloud

::: promptbox
**Prompt:**  
Read the following equations aloud and describe what they’re instructing you to do:

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\big[f(x) + g(x)\big] = f'(x) + g'(x)
\]

\[
\frac{d}{dx}\big[f(x) - g(x)\big] = f'(x) - g'(x)
\]

| Symbol / Term | What It Tells You To Do |
|:---------------|:------------------------|
| \( f(x) + g(x) \) | |
| \( f'(x) + g'(x) \) | |
| \( f(x) - g(x) \) | |
| \( f'(x) - g'(x) \) | |

**Notes:**  
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
:::

---

### Step 2: Translate to a Step-by-Step Recipe

::: promptbox
**Activity (Think–Pair–Share):**  
Write the *recipe* the Sum and Difference Rules describe in your own words.

1. Break the function into parts being added or subtracted.  
2. Take the derivative of each part *individually*.  
3. Keep the same operation (addition or subtraction) between them.  
4. Simplify the result.

Now apply this recipe to three quick examples:

| Function \( f(x) \) | Steps You’d Take | Derivative \( f'(x) \) |
|:--------------------:|:----------------|:-----------------------:|
| \( x^2 + 3x \) | | |
| \( 4x^3 - 5x^2 \) | | |
| \( 2x^4 - 7x + 9 \) | | |

**Notes:**  
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
:::

---

### Step 3: Deriving the Rule from the Limit Definition

Let’s see how this rule arises from the **limit definition of the derivative**.

We start with:
\[
h'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{h(x+h) - h(x)}{h}
\]
and let \( h(x) = f(x) + g(x) \).

Then:
\[
h'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{[f(x+h) + g(x+h)] - [f(x) + g(x)]}{h}
\]

Simplify:
\[
h'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} + \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}
\]

Recognize each term as a derivative:
\[
\boxed{h'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x)}
\]

The same reasoning works for subtraction:
\[
\boxed{\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) - g(x)] = f'(x) - g'(x)}
\]

In short — **differentiation distributes over addition and subtraction.**

---

### Step 4: Apply the Instructions to a Real Example

::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Let \( f(x) = 3x^3 + 4x^2 - 10x \).

1. Identify how many terms there are.  
2. Apply the derivative to each term using the Power Rule.  
3. Combine the results.  
4. Simplify your answer.

### Step 5: Visualize What’s Happening

::: promptbox
**Visualization Prompt:**  
Examine the graphs of \( f(x) = x^2 \) and \( g(x) = x \).  
Their sum \( f(x) + g(x) \) combines both shapes —  
the derivative \( f'(x) + g'(x) \) describes how *both rates of change* add together at each point.
