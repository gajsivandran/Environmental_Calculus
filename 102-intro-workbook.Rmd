# Pre-Calculus Foundations Workbook

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Interpret and compare functions from **graphs**, **tables**, and **formulas**.  
- Track **units** through computations and check results for reasonableness.  
- Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of **time** and **elevation**.  

It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don‚Äôt worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar‚Äîwe‚Äôll walk through each concept with context and practice.  

This chapter is designed to help you **review and refresh** the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a **toolbox**: later chapters will point to specific tools you‚Äôll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context‚Äîso come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher.

## How We Communicate Relationships

Functions describe how one quantity depends on another. We can show this relationship in different ways:

- Words  
- Graphs  
- Tables  
- Equations  

Each representation tells the story differently. Some make patterns clear, others make calculations easy.

---

### Your Turn
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Try using **each representation**:

- Write a short statement in words.  
- Sketch or imagine a graph.  
- Create a small table of values.  
- Suggest a simple equation.  

Then reflect:  
- What are the pros/cons of each method?  
- What do you gain or lose when switching representations?  

**Notes:**

## Functions and Their Representations

Functions are input‚Äìoutput machines: you put something in, apply a rule, and get something out.  
They can be written in many forms, but always represent a relationship.



---

### Understanding \(f(x)\)
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  

- What does \(f(x)\) mean in your own words?  
- Identify the **input**, the **rule**, and the **output** in a function.  
- Give one real-world example of a function you‚Äôve seen.

**Notes:**  

<br><br>  <br><br> <br><br> 

:::

---

### Meaningful Names
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Lets look at two functions:

- a generic function like \(f(x) = 0.2x + 3\) 
- \(T(d) = 0.2d +3\) where d is distance from the shore and T is the land temperature  

  - What are the differences between these two functions?  
  - How does changing the variable names affect interpretation?
  - How does changing the variable names change the results?

**Notes:**  

<br><br>  <br><br> <br><br> 
  
:::

### Multiple Inputs
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Think of an environmental process that depends on more than one variable.  

- Write a function with **two inputs** (e.g., \(T(t,h)\) for temperature as a function of time and elevation).  
- What do each of the variables and parameters represent?  
- Which variables might you ignore to keep the model simple?  

**Notes:**

### Activity: Growth of a Tree
::: promptbox
**Prompt:**  
In a group, discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree.

  \[\text{Growth} = f(\text{Variable 1}, \text{Variable 2}, \ldots)  \]  
- How many variables drive tree growth?  
- Which ones would you include first in a simple model?

**Notes:**  

<br><br>  <br><br> <br><br> 
  
:::

---

### Activity: Modeling Temperature
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
We can model temperature as a function of **time** and **elevation**:  

- Start with a daily cycle at sea level.  
- Adjust with the lapse rate (‚Äì6.5 ¬∞C per 1000 m).  
- Combine them into \(T(t,h)\).  

Reflect:  

- At what time of day is the difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest?  
- What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases?  
- Which variable (time or elevation) has the stronger effect in your model?  

**Notes:**

### Activity: Telling the Story of a Complex Equation
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Consider the following model for photosynthesis in a plant canopy:  

\[
A(t, I, T) = A_{\max} \cdot \frac{I}{I + K} \cdot e^{-0.01(T - 25)^2} \cdot (1 - e^{-0.1t})
\]

Where:  
- \(A(t, I, T)\) = photosynthesis rate (¬µmol CO‚ÇÇ m‚Åª¬≤ s‚Åª¬π)  
- \(A_{\max}\) = maximum photosynthesis capacity  
- \(I\) = light intensity (¬µmol photons m‚Åª¬≤ s‚Åª¬π)  
- \(K\) = half-saturation constant for light  
- \(T\) = temperature (¬∞C)  
- \(t\) = time since sunrise (hours)  

**Prompt:** 

- Tell the *story* of this equation in plain language.  
- How does each factor (light, temperature, time) influence photosynthesis?  
- Which parts of the equation act like **limits** or **controls**?  
- What would happen if one variable stayed constant while the others changed?

## Graphing and Interpreting Change

### Key Ideas to Explore
- When is a function **increasing** or **decreasing**?  
- Where are the **peaks and valleys**?  
- How does the graph **bend** (concavity)?  
- How do these patterns connect to environmental systems?  

---

### Practice Reading a Graph
::: promptbox
**Activity:**  
Look at a graph of a quadratic function (or sketch one).

```{r practice-reading-graph, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Quadratic function for practice: Where is it increasing or decreasing?"}
# Define a quadratic function
f <- function(x) { -x^2 + 4*x + 5 }

# Create x values
x_vals <- seq(-1, 5, length.out = 200)
y_vals <- f(x_vals)

# Plot the curve
plot(x_vals, y_vals, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "steelblue",
     xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)",
     main = "Practice: Reading a Quadratic Graph")

```

- Where is it increasing? Where is it decreasing?  
- How do you know when the slope is positive, zero, or negative?  
- What real-world system might this graph represent?

### The Ball Analogy
::: promptbox
**Discussion Prompt:**  
Imagine throwing a ball straight up in the air.  
```{r blank-axes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Empty axes for sketching height vs. time."}
# Create empty plot with axis labels
plot(NA, xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 20),
     xlab = "Time [s]", ylab = "Height above ground [m]",
     main = "Sketch: Height vs Time")
```

Try to sketch the vertical position of the ball through time.

- When is it rising?  
- When is it at its peak?  
- When is it falling?  
- How does the slope of the height vs. time graph change throughout?  

**Notes:**  
<br><br>  <br><br> <br><br> 
 
:::

---

### Cubic Example
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Consider the function \(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\).  

```{r cubic-example-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Cubic function example with turning points."}
# Define cubic function
f <- function(x) { x^3 - 6*x^2 + 9*x + 2 }

# Values
x_vals <- seq(-1, 6, length.out = 300)
y_vals <- f(x_vals)

# Plot
plot(x_vals, y_vals, type = "l", lwd = 2, col = "steelblue",
     xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)",
     main = "Cubic Function Example")

# Approximate turning points (critical points at derivative roots)
x1 <- 1
x2 <- 3

```

- Where is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing?  
- Where does it reach local maxima and minima?  
- How does the concavity change (curving up vs curving down)?  
- What real-world process might this model - can you tell a story?

For each:

- Where is it increasing/decreasing?  
- Where would you expect peaks or valleys?  
- How does concavity help tell the story?

## Key Function Types 

Here are some of the most common function types you‚Äôll see in environmental systems:

| Function Type | Form | Example |
|---------------|------|---------|
| Linear        | \(y = mx + b\) | Streamflow increasing steadily over time |
| Quadratic     | \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\) | Pollution dispersal from a point source |
| Exponential   | \(y = a \cdot b^x\) | Invasive species population growth |
| Logarithmic   | \(y = \log(x)\) | pH scale or sound intensity |

---

### Explore the Shapes
::: promptbox
**Practice:**  
Sketch the graphs of **linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic** functions.  

```{r function-type-blank-axes-clean2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Clean blank axes without labels for sketching."}
# Set up 2x2 plotting area, square aspect
par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = c(3, 3, 3, 1), pty = "s")

# Linear
plot(NA, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Linear",
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n", asp = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = "gray")

# Quadratic
plot(NA, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Quadratic",
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n", asp = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = "gray")

# Exponential
plot(NA, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Exponential",
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n", asp = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = "gray")

# Logarithmic
plot(NA, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(-5, 5),
     xlab = "", ylab = "", main = "Logarithmic",
     xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n", bty = "n", asp = 1)
abline(h = 0, v = 0, col = "gray")

# Reset plotting area
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

- How do they look different?  
- Which ones keep increasing forever?  
- Which ones turn around?  
- What about curvature?

### Why Units Matter
::: promptbox
**Practice:**

  - \(v\) = velocity )  

- Write typical **units** for each of the variables.  
- Do the units on both sides of the equation **match**?  
- If not, what needs to change?
