![](images/hands.png){fig.alt='Decorative' style="float:right; width:250px; margin:10px;"}

- Please feel free to bring your breakfast/lunch to class – just be sure to clean up before you leave
- Bring whatever tech you need to take notes and engage. We will be using Poll everywhere 
- Ask questions – but please be respectful of all voices and views - wrong answers have more value than right ones!

**Class discussion**

Why do you think there is so much weight on tests and participation?

### Acedemic Integrity

This class has been designed to reward you for doing your **own** work
Tests will be relatively straightforward if you make the effort on the in-class and homework assessments

Using these resources will only make studying for tests harder. Many of these resources give you the *illusion* of understanding - but the reality is quite different.

### Late Assessment / Missed Assessment Policy

This is a firm policy to make sure I am being fair to all of you.

**Grace period:** Homeworks for this class are due Friday at 11:59pm. Homeworks will be accepted 72 hrs after their due date with no penalty (Monday 11:59pm). Graded work not turned in by this time will receive a grade of zero.

**Missed Tests**: If you miss a test, you will need to use one of your 're-takes' during finals weeks to do it. However, if you have a legitimate reason, I will work with you to reschedule the test earlier so you can save your re-take.

**Missed Class Preparation/Participation:** From time to time we miss class for several reasons (studying for another test that day, field work, illness, etc). There will be **no opportunity** to submit preparation and participation activities if they are missed. The purpose of these activities are to reinforce concepts in the moment – and have little value out the context of the material being covered that day.

To accommodate for this, 5% of the total preparation and participation assessments will be dropped. There will also be additional extra-credit opportunities throughout the term. 

**Exceptional Circumstances**: You must contact me 48 hours before the **actual** due date (not after the 48hr grace period) of a graded assignment to give me advanced notice, or within 12 hours after the work is due in the case of an emergency. If you fail to do this, you will receive zero credit for the missed assignment.

What do we consider **exceptional circumstances**?

### Test Retakes Policy

There is no Final in this class – BUT – I will use the finals timeslot for the retakes. So don't plan an early break if you think you might be doing a retake.

If you miss a test during the term for a valid reason (health, emergency etc) and inform me in a timely manner, I’ll schedule a time during office hours for you to take the test. This flexibility is only good for a couple of days as I want to get the graded tests back to the rest of the class.

If you miss a test for another reason (slept in, went to a wedding etc) you can always use one of your retakes – that’s what they are for.

Reasons to retake
Missed a test
Want to try for a better grade
Love calc so much you want to do more problems

You can retake upto 2 tests. Your best score counts – so no risk

### Office Hours

![](images/when2meet.png){fig.alt='Decorative cartoon of common excuses' style="float:left; width:100px; margin:10px;"}

Please select ALL times that **could** work.

I will always try to hang around for 30mins or so after class to answer any questions.

Office hours will be posted on Canvas as soon as they are set.

<br><br><br>

### Class notes

All notes that I take in class are available on the onenote notebook link on Canvas
All lectures will be recorded - these will also be made available on Canvas

From time to time the technology will fail us. Remember these are being provided as a *bonus*. There is no substitute for attending class and taking your own notes.

## Paper Planes

::: promptbox

**Paper Plane Activity**
We are going to make paper planes and then see how well they fly.

We are going to break into 4 groups:

- Group 1: Instructions not included – I know how to make a paper plane already
- Group 2: Notes -  Watch the video multiple times, pausing and taking notes – I’m confident I can make a good plane
- Group 3: Team – Work together and make 1 TEAM plane. 
- Group 4: Solo first + then team up - Make your own plane, then make a team plane

## Rate of Change - A First Look

::: promptbox

**Class Discussion**


![](images/Bolt.png){fig.alt='Picture of Usain Bolt winning a 100m race' style="float:right; width:300px; margin:10px;"}

When we try to understand derivatives, the most common place to start is Position->Velocity->Acceleration and how they are linked.

Lets have a look at this while watching Usain Bolt run the 100m in 9.69s

While we watch this video I want you to keep in mind the idea of change - what variables are changing as we move through this race.

[Usain Bolt 100m Record](https://www.youtube.com/clip/UgkxYLQtjngzm0z_y34zOcFQH24uIOKdLFCd){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

**Group Discussion**

1) How fast did he run? Can you calculate it?
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

2) What was the fastest he ran? OR what was his top speed (velocity)?
When do you think this happened?
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

3)The time it took him to get to 10m markers was measured, and the plot is below. What does this tell us about how fast he ran?

![](images/Bolt2.png){fig.alt='Position vs time graph, showing ten segments, each with slightly different slopes, the first segment took 1.83s, a segment in the middle of the race took 0.82s' style="width:500px; margin:10px;"}
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


4)If we fit a smooth curve to this path, instead of looking at the slope over every 10m, we can look at the **instantaneous rate of change** or the derivative at any point. 

Note: The reason the curve needs to be smooth will be covered later - this is all just a preview

![](images/Bolt3.png){fig.alt='Position vs time grpah, but instead of straight line segments, it is one smooth line through the points' style="width:500px; margin:10px;"}
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

5) No if we calculate the instantaneous rate of change and plot it against time - we get the velocity vs time relationship.

Using this - try to describe how is velocity (speed) varied during the race.

![](images/Bolt4.png){fig.alt='Velocity vs time grpah, shows the velocity increase at the start of the race, then level out, before decreasing at the end of the race. In the video the decrease was associated with Usain Bolt celebrating early' style="width:500px; margin:10px;"}
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

6) The world wondered how fast he could actually run the 100m. A year later at the world championships sensors were places along the tract to capture in high resolution his position with time.

- What do you notice this time?
- What is causing the oscillating in the red line?

![](images/Bolt5.png){fig.alt='Velocity vs time grpah, black line shows increasing velcity and then levels out at 12m/s, the red line shows the instantaneous velocity whcih oscilates around the average through the race' style="width:500px; margin:10px;"}
