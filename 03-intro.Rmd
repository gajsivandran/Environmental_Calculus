# Pre-Calculus Foundations

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Interpret and compare functions from **graphs**, **tables**, and **formulas**.  
- Track **units** through computations and check results for reasonableness.  
- Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of **time** and **elevation**.  

It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice.  

This chapter is designed to help you **review and refresh** the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a **toolbox**: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher.  

---

## What You’re Expected to Know

To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with:

- Working with functions and interpreting graphs  
- Manipulating algebraic equations  
- Rules for exponents and logarithms  
- Understanding and converting units  
- Reading and setting up word problems  

If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal. This chapter is here to get you back up to speed—and to remind you that you already have more tools than you might think.

## How to Approach Calculus Problems

Understanding calculus isn’t about memorizing steps—it’s about learning to *think mathematically* so you can interpret real-world change. It’s normal for parts of this to feel unfamiliar at first; progress comes from trying, checking, and revising. In this course, we’ll model environmental systems—temperature, rainfall, population dynamics—and the goal is clarity, not perfection on the first attempt. 

When you get stuck, start small: sketch the situation, label axes and units, compute one example value, and say out loud what a slope or an area means **in context**. Treat mistakes as information, not judgment—they show you what to try next. Keep going; you’re building tools you’ll use well beyond this class.

Here’s a strategy to help you become a more confident problem solver:

---

### Clarify the Ask

- What is being asked?  
- Is the question about a **rate of change**, a **maximum/minimum**, or an **accumulated quantity**?  
- What type of function or scenario is involved (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.)?

> *Always start by identifying what quantities are changing and how they’re related.*

---

### List the Givens

- Write down the **given information** clearly.  
- Label all **variables**, **units**, and **known values**.  
- If a graph or context is given, sketch or summarize what you see.

> *Clarity in setup is half the solution.*

---

### Translate the Math

Equations are not just symbols—they are **instructions**:

- Each **term** contributes to the behavior of the function.  
- **Operators** (+, −, ×, ÷, …) tell you what actions to take.  
- **Derivatives** tell you how the function is changing.

> *Don’t rush through the algebra. Pause and ask: “What is this term telling me?”*

---

### Work Step by Step

Instead of aiming straight for the final answer, focus on the **process**:

- Write out **what** you’re doing and **why**.  
- If you take a derivative, explain what it represents (e.g., “This is the rate of change of population over time.”)  
- Label your steps so they can be traced logically.

> *When taking notes, don’t just copy answers. Write procedures and reasoning—this builds transferable understanding.*

---

### Reflect and Interpret

- Does your answer make sense in context?  
- Are the **units** correct?  
- Is the **magnitude** reasonable?  
- What does your result say about the **system** you’re studying?

> *In environmental science, the interpretation is as important as the calculation.*

---

### Growth Mindset

You may not see math in every class you take—that’s okay. Our goal here is to build **confidence** and **numerical literacy**.

Solving math problems is a **step-by-step** process. Thinking too far ahead can cause confusion. Take it **one step at a time**—that’s how you make progress.

Also, try not to **overthink** mid-solution. If you tried to narrate every muscle movement while climbing stairs, you might trip. Trust yourself. Don’t **second-guess** every step—work through to the end. When you reflect, you’ll catch errors and sharpen your thinking.

> *Confidence grows by doing. Keep moving forward—even imperfect progress builds understanding.*

Athletes know this: when you overanalyze your swing *while* swinging, performance often gets worse. Much of skilled work is partly **automatic**. Bringing every detail into the **conscious** mind can interrupt your flow.

Trust your instincts. Don’t be afraid to commit to your approach. **Swing through**—you’ll learn more by finishing a solution than by freezing in doubt.

---

## How We Communicate Relationships

By thinking of functions as **input-output machines** and visualizing them on a graph, you'll be better equipped to interpret and model relationships in environmental systems and beyond.

![input arrow, pointing to a box with the word function in it, with an arrow leaving the box labelled output](images/In_out.png)

A function represents a relationship between two quantities: an **input** and an **output**. The way we represent and communicate this is through:

-   Verbal descriptions
-   Graphical representations like charts
-   Tables of data
-   Formulas that capture the relationship


## Understanding What \(f(x)\) Means

You’ve probably seen the equation of a line written like this:

\[
y = mx + b
\]

This is the same as writing:

\[
f(x) = mx + b
\]

Both notations describe the same relationship. Here’s what they mean:

- \(x\) is the **input** (what you plug into the function).  
- \(f(x)\) or \(y\) is the **output** (what comes out after applying the function rule).  

Graphically:

- The **input** is usually plotted along the **x-axis**.  
- The **output** (\(y\) or \(f(x)\)) is plotted along the **y-axis**.  

So when you see a point like \((4, 11)\), it means:

- Input \(x = 4\) produces output \(f(x) = 11\).  

A function is like a **black box**: you put something in, a rule is applied, and you get something out.  

For example:

\[
f(x) = 2x + 3
\]

If we input \(x = 4\):

\[
f(4) = 2 \cdot 4 + 3 = 11
\]

So the point \((4, 11)\) would appear on the graph.

- Input: \(x = 4\)  
- Rule: multiply by 2, then add 3  
- Output: \(f(4) = 11\)  

If into the same function we input 🐶 then we end up
\[
f(🐶) = 2🐶+3
\]

everywhere there was an x, we replaced it with the new input 🐶.

---

### Functions Don’t Have to Be Named \(f\)

Functions can be named in ways that make their meaning clearer. For example:

- \(T(t)\) for **temperature** as a function of **time**  
- \(P(n)\) for **population** as a function of **years**  

The variable also doesn’t always have to be \(x\). Choosing names that match the context makes your math easier to read, easier to explain, and easier to connect to the real world.  

---

#### Why Meaningful Function Names Matter

Suppose we want to model how land temperature **T** (in °C) changes with distance **d** (in km) from the shore. We could write the function in a very generic way:

\[
f(x) = 0.2x + 3
\]

Here, **f** is the temperature and **x** is the distance. This works mathematically, but it doesn’t tell us much about what the variables *mean*.  

A clearer way is to use variables that match the context:

\[
T(d) = 0.2d + 3
\]

Now the function communicates something immediately:  

- \(T(d)\) = land temperature (°C)  
- \(d\) = distance from the coast (km)  

This version is not only valid but **more meaningful**:  

> *“Temperature increases by 0.2°C for every kilometer inland, starting from 3°C at the coast.”*

By naming functions and variables in ways that reflect the system being studied, we make the math easier to interpret, easier to explain, and easier to apply.  

---

### Functions Can Have More Than One Input \(\, f(x,y) \)

Many environmental processes depend on more than one variable. For example, the distribution of a terrestrial species might be best described as a function of \(x\) and \(y\), where \(x\) is longitude and \(y\) is latitude.  

**Thinking further:** what would the function look like for the location of a species in **three dimensions**, such as mapping their position in a water column? How would you write this mathematically?  

In reality, many environmental systems depend on far more than three variables. When building models, the art is in **simplifying**: choosing the key variables that matter most for the question at hand. Including every possible factor would be too complex to work with, so we focus on what’s essential.

**Activity: Modeling Temperature as a Function of Time and Elevation**

**Learning Goals**

-   Understand how to construct and interpret a function of two variables.
-   Apply environmental context to multivariable functions.
-   Visualize how elevation impacts the daily temperature cycle using lapse rate.

At sea level, the temperature throughout the day is modeled by:

-   $T(t) = 10 - 5 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{12}\right)  [°C]$

Temperature decreases with elevation, at a lapse rate of 6.5°C per 1000 meters:

-   $L= \frac{6.5}{1000} = 0.0065 [\frac{°C}{m}]$

The temperature as a function of elevation alone (assuming sea level temperature is 10°C):

-   $T(h) = 10 - 0.0065 \cdot h$

So the temperature as a function of both time t and elevation h is:

-   $T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\pi t}{12}\right) - 0.0065 \cdot h$

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)

## Define the temperature function
T <- function(t, h) {
  10 - 5 * cos(pi * t / 12) - 0.0065 * h
}

## Create the data frame
temp_df <- data.frame(
  Time_h = c(6, 6, 6, 12, 12, 18, 18),
  Elevation_m = c(0, 500, 1500, 0, 1000, 2000, 5000)
)

## Compute temperature and round for presentation
temp_df$Temperature_C <- round(T(temp_df$Time_h, temp_df$Elevation_m), 2)

## Nicely formatted markdown table
kable(
  temp_df,
  col.names = c("Time (hours)", "Elevation (m)", "Temperature (°C)"),
  caption = "Modeled temperature as a function of time and elevation."
)
```

**Reflection:**

-   At what time of day is the temperature difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest?
-   What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases?
-   Does the timing of the warmest part of the day change with elevation?
-   Stare at this equation T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \* cos(pi \* t / 12) - 0.0065 \* h, can you visualize the impact of t? what about h?
-   The equation could have been written as f(x, y) = 10 - 5 \* cos(pi \* x / 12) - 0.0065 \* y, would this be harder to interpret?

  geom_contour_filled() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature as a Function of Time and Elevation",

}

## Time sequence
t_vals <- seq(0, 24, by = 0.1)

## Elevations to plot
elevations <- c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 4392)

## Create a data frame for each elevation
temp_data <- lapply(elevations, function(h) {
  data.frame(
    time = t_vals,
    temp = T_func(t_vals, h),
    elevation = paste0(h, " m")
  )
}) %>%
  bind_rows()

    xaxis = list(title = "Time of Day (hours)"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Temperature (°C)"),
    legend = list(title = list(text = "Elevation"))
  )
```

## Graphing and Interpreting Change

Understanding the shape of a graph is crucial for interpreting real-world phenomena. Here are key features to notice:

-   **Increasing/Decreasing:** Is the function going up or down as $x$ increases?
-   **Peaks and Valleys:** Where are the local maxima and minima?
-   **Concavity:** Does the curve bend upward (concave up) or downward (concave down)?

Let's look at an example of a quadratic function, which is commonly used to model situations with a single peak or valley. This function is an increasing function for $x<2$ and decreasing for $x>2$. It has a maximum at $x=2$. We can also notice that the concavity of the function is concave down.

We can also look at the how the function is **changing** as we move along the x axis. At $x=0$ the slope of the function is positive and steep. As we approach the maximum, the slope of the function is still positive, but its not increasing as fast. We could say its increasing at a decreasing rate. At the peak, the function is not longer changing. Now as we pass $x=2$ the function is decreasing slowly at first, but faster and faster as $x$ gets further away from the peak.

You can think of this as a ball in your hand. You throw it up, initially its moving fast, but as gravity acts on the ball it slows. Then for an instance, the ball hangs in the air - this is where it reaches its peak. Then the ball starts to fall, slowly at first, but it then begins to fall faster and faster.

```{r graph-change-example, echo=FALSE}
f <- function(x) { -x^2 + 4*x + 5 }
curve(f, from = 0, to = 6, main = "Quadratic Function", ylab = "f(x)", xlab = "x")
abline(h = 0, col = "gray", lty = 2)
```

The calculus you will learn in this course will give you the tools needed to quantify these observations. Identify the rates of change at different point and find the maximas and minimas.

## Key Function Types

Here are five common functions you'll encounter:

| Function Type |        Form         |          Environmental Example          |
|:----------------:|:------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|    Linear     |    $y = mx + b$     |     Streamflow increasing over time     |
|   Quadratic   | $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ | Pollution dispersal from a point source |
|  Exponential  |  $y = a \cdot b^x$  |         Invasive species growth         |
|  Logarithmic  |    $y = \log(x)$    |          pH or sound intensity          |

## Units, Rates, and Word Problems

Units are a scientist’s best friend. They don’t just tell us *what* we’re measuring—they also help us check if our answers make sense. In calculus, units play a central role because they give meaning to **rates of change** (derivatives) and **accumulations** (integrals).

Here are some common examples in environmental science:

- Atmospheric CO₂ concentration is measured in **ppm** (parts per million).  
- Rainfall might be reported in **mm/hour**.  
- Streamflow can be given in **m³/s** (cubic meters per second).  
- Tree growth might be in **cm/year**.  

---

### Why Units Matter

Think of units as *guardrails* for problem solving:

- They help you avoid mistakes (e.g., mixing meters with kilometers).  
- They give physical meaning to abstract symbols.  
- They allow you to compare across systems and scales.  

If your answer has the wrong units, it’s almost certainly the wrong answer.

---

#### A Famous Example: The Mars Orbiter Mishap 🚀

In 1999, NASA lost the **Mars Climate Orbiter**, a spacecraft that cost **$390 million** to design, build, and launch—all because of a simple unit conversion error.  

- One engineering team used **English units** (pound-seconds of force).  
- Another team assumed **metric units** (Newton-seconds).  
- The mismatch went unnoticed, and the spacecraft’s trajectory was off course.  

The result: the orbiter entered Mars’ atmosphere at the wrong altitude and was destroyed.  


This dramatic example shows why scientists and engineers obsess over units. While our classroom mistakes won’t crash a $390 million spacecraft, they can still derail your reasoning. Keeping track of units is one of the simplest—and most powerful—ways to check your work.  

---

::: activity
**Activity: Average Rate of Change**

Suppose atmospheric CO₂ increases from **400 ppm** to **420 ppm** over **5 years**.  

Calculate the **average rate of change**

Now repeat the process but this time no numbers, run the same calculation with just the units. What do you end up with?

Now tell me the story of what your calculation means?

**Reflection Questions**

- What if we reported the time in **months** instead of years? How would the rate change?  
- What if the increase had been **400 → 420 ppm in 10 years** — what happens to the rate?  
- Does “average rate” mean CO₂ increased by exactly 4 ppm every year? Why or why not?  

:::

### Key Idea

A **rate of change** always involves comparing how much one quantity changes relative to another.  

\[
\text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Change in Output}}{\text{Change in Input}}
\]

- If the input is **time**, the rate tells us “how fast” something changes.  
- If the input is **distance**, the rate might describe a gradient (e.g., temperature lapse rate with elevation).  
- If the input is **volume**, the rate might describe a concentration per unit volume.  

> *Units don’t just check your work—they tell the story of what the math means.*  


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Getting Comfortable with Word Problems

Environmental word problems are at the heart of applying calculus. They take a real-world situation and ask you to identify the quantities involved, describe how they are changing, and build a model that captures those changes.  

When you read a word problem, pause and ask yourself:

- **What is changing?** (What’s the variable of interest?)  
- **How fast is it changing?** (Are we talking about a *rate* or an *accumulated total*?)  
- **What influences that change?** (Is it driven by time, distance, elevation, or something else?)  

---

### Why Word Problems Matter

Anyone can compute a derivative or an integral once the equation is written down. The real challenge—and the real skill—is **translating words into math**. That’s what lets you use calculus to model glaciers, forests, rivers, or populations.  

Remember: there is no single “right” way to start. Sketching, making a table, or writing down what you know in words are all valid first steps.  

---

### Example Problem

> A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What mathematical tools would help you model this?  

**Step 1. What’s changing?**  

- The glacier’s **thickness or volume** is decreasing.  

**Step 2. How is it changing?** 

- The rate of melt is itself *increasing over time*. That means the rate is not constant.  

**Step 3. What tools do we need?**  

- A **derivative** describes the melt rate at a given moment.  
- An **integral** (this is a preview of 292) could estimate the total ice lost over a span of years.  
- Because the rate is changing, an **exponential** or **quadratic** function might be a better fit than a linear one.  

---

::: activity
**Activity: Rate of change around us**

- What other environmental situations involve a rate that changes over time (not just a constant rate)? Discuss and share back with the class  
- How would you represent this glacier problem with a **graph**? With a **table**?  
- If you only had measurements of ice thickness each year, how would you estimate the rate of change?  

:::

---

### Key Idea

Word problems are really about *translation*. You’re moving between:  

- **Verbal description** → “the glacier is melting faster each year”  
- **Mathematical model** → equations that capture this trend  
- **Interpretation** → what the math tells us about the glacier and its future  

> *The math is the language, but the story is always about the system you’re studying.*  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Practice: Interpreting Functions

### What Are You Practicing?

In this section, you’ll get more comfortable reading, interpreting, and evaluating functions — especially those that model environmental systems.

You’ll see functions written in different forms (formulas, graphs, tables), and you’ll practice thinking about what the **input** and **output** represent.

This is an important foundation for calculus. When we interpret derivatives later on, we’ll always come back to **what is this function telling us about the real world?**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Approach These Problems

For any function, try answering these three questions:

1.  **What are the input(s) and output?**\
    What does the function take in, and what does it give back?

2.  **What do the variables represent?**\
    For example, is $t$ time? Is $T(t)$ a temperature? What are the units?

3.  **What does the formula tell you about the relationship?**\
    If the function is increasing or decreasing, by how much?\
    Are there any constants or slopes that describe rates?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Practice Problems

Try these on your own or with a partner. Don’t just plug in numbers — ask what the function is saying!

Every 1000 m:
\[

## Practice: Reading Graphs & Tables

### What Are You Practicing?

In this section, you’ll strengthen your ability to read and interpret visual and tabular representations of functions. In environmental science, data is often collected and communicated through graphs and tables, so being fluent in interpreting these is essential.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Approach These Problems

When working with graphs or tables, try answering:

1.  **What trend do you see?**\
    Is the function increasing, decreasing, leveling off, or fluctuating?

2.  **What do the axes and labels tell you?**\
    What units are being used? What do the variables represent?

3.  **Can you predict values not directly shown?**\
    Can you estimate an in-between value? Can you guess the shape of the full function?

---

### Practice Problems

Use reasoning and estimation to explore these problems. Think in terms of *shape* and *behavior* before trying to be exact.

**🟢 Level 1: Getting Comfortable**

**1.** Here is a table showing the number of insects counted in a trap each day:

| Day | Insects |
|:---:|:-------:|
|  0  |   10    |
|  1  |   14    |
|  2  |   19    |
|  3  |   25    |
|  4  |   32    |

**a.** Describe in words what you notice in the rate of increase.  
**b.** Interpolate the number of insects at 0.5 days.  
**c.** Extrapolate the number of insects on day 5.  
**d.** What is the difference between interpolation and extrapolation?

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to reveal solution</strong></summary>

**a.**  
The number of insects is increasing, and the *amount added each day* is getting larger. This suggests the rate of increase itself is increasing.

**b.**  
Between day 0 and day 1, insects increase from 10 to 14.  
Halfway (day 0.5), a reasonable estimate is:
\[
\frac{10 + 14}{2} = 12
\]

**c.**  
From day 3 to day 4, the increase is \(32 - 25 = 7\).  
If that trend continues, an estimate for day 5 is:
\[
32 + 7 = 39
\]

**d.**  

- **Interpolation** estimates values *within* the data range.  
- **Extrapolation** estimates values *outside* the data range and is more uncertain.

|  4   |     12        |
|  5   |     15        |

## Practice: Building Functions from Context

### What Are You Practicing?

In this section, you'll practice translating real-world environmental scenarios into mathematical functions. This skill is key to modeling — the process of using math to represent relationships between variables like time, temperature, and elevation.

You’ll learn how to:

- Identify input and output variables 
- Write clear, meaningful function names 
- Move between **verbal descriptions**, **tables**, **graphs**, and **equations**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### How to Approach These Problems

When you’re given a word problem, follow these steps:

1.  **Identify what's changing**\
    Is the input time? Distance? Elevation?

2.  **Define your variables**\
    Choose names that make sense — like $G(t)$ for glacier thickness or $T(h)$ for temperature at elevation.

3.  **Look for rates or starting values**\
    Most real-world functions are built from a starting point and a rate of change.

4.  **Build the equation**\
    Most problems can be written as:\
    $$
    \text{Output} = \text{Starting Value} \pm \text{Rate} \cdot \text{Input}
    $$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example**

A glacier melts by 1.2 meters per year. It is currently 120 meters thick.

**a.** Write a function $G(t)$ to model the glacier thickness $t$ years from now.\
**b.** How thick will the glacier be in 10 years?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Solution:**

-   Let $G(t)$ represent the glacier thickness in meters at time $t$ (in years)
-   Initial thickness = 120 m\
-   Melting rate = 1.2 m/year

$$
G(t) = 120 - 1.2t
$$

**Evaluate:**

$$
G(10) = 120 - 1.2(10) = 108 \text{ meters}
$$

### Function Composition & Inverses

 **How-To**  

 - Composition: $f(g(x))$ means plug the entire rule of $g(x)$ into $f$.  
 - Example: if $f(x) = 2x+1$ and $g(x) = x^2$, then  
   $f(g(x)) = 2(x^2) + 1$.  
 - Inverse Functions: An inverse "undoes" the original function.  
   By definition, $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ (for $x$ in the domain).  

 **Tip:** To find an inverse, swap $x$ and $y$, then solve for $y$.
