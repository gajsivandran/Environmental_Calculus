Welcome to Calculus for Environmental Science.  This book is your companion for exploring the natural world through the lens of calculus—especially the powerful ideas of change and accumulation. You’ll find that calculus is not just about symbols on a page—it’s about asking meaningful questions, interpreting patterns, and making sense of complex environmental systems. And along the way, you’ll see that you are absolutely capable of mastering these ideas. 1.1 Why This Book? Most calculus textbooks lean heavily on physics examples—motion, velocity, and acceleration—because calculus was originally developed to solve physics problems. Those examples are powerful, and we’ll use them from time to time because they give us an intuitive “feel” for how change works. But today, calculus is a tool used across many disciplines: biology, ecology, environmental science, economics, engineering, and beyond. In this book, we’ll focus on examples that resonate with your studies and your interests as an environmental scientist. Environmental scientists face some of the most urgent and complex challenges of our time—climate change, biodiversity loss, resource management, and pollution. Calculus gives us tools to: Predict how systems evolve over time Estimate impacts and risks Model natural and human systems with differential equations Analyze rates of change and long-term accumulation Throughout this book, you’ll work with real environmental data, use visual and conceptual approaches, and practice skills that matter for sustainability. Our goal is not just to “get through calculus,” but to see how these mathematical ideas open doors for discovery and problem-solving in the real world. 1.2 What Is Calculus? At its heart, calculus is the mathematics of change and accumulation. These two ideas are everywhere in science: The rate of CO₂ increase in the atmosphere is a derivative. The total added CO₂ over a year is an integral. Traditionally, calculus is first introduced through physics examples like velocity (rate of change of position) and acceleration (rate of change of velocity). These are helpful because most of us can feel what it means to move faster or slower. We’ll use those examples when they make ideas clearer. But throughout this book, our main goal is to connect calculus directly to the environment you are studying. You’ll see derivatives and integrals applied to population growth, forest carbon storage, water flow in rivers, and other natural systems. We’ll build your understanding of these concepts step by step, supported by graphs, data, and hands-on examples. And if it’s been a while since your last math class, that’s completely okay—you’ll find plenty of support here. We’ll meet you where you are and grow your skills together. 1.3 How This Book Works Each chapter is designed to support you as a learner. You’ll find: Clear explanations of key concepts Environmental examples to connect math with meaning Practice problems to strengthen your skills Reflection prompts to help you think about what you’re learning 1.4 Success in This Class First and foremost, know this: we believe in your ability to learn and grow. You bring unique strengths and perspectives, and your effort matters here. Mistakes are not a setback—they are the very heart of learning. When you get something wrong, you uncover where your thinking needs refinement, and that creates the space for real growth. Struggle is not a sign you don’t belong; it’s proof that your brain is stretching and building new connections. Just like in science, learning calculus is about iteration—trying, testing, revising, and improving. That process is what makes your understanding deeper and more durable. Assessments in this class are snapshots of your thinking at a particular moment in time. They are not final judgments about your intelligence, your worth, or your potential. You will have chances to revisit concepts, refine your understanding, and demonstrate what you’ve learned. Growth comes from re-engaging with the material, not from perfection on the first try. So give yourself permission to be imperfect. Keep engaging, reflecting, and asking questions. We’ll be here to support you every step of the way. 1.5 Looking Ahead By the end of this course, you will be able to: Apply calculus concepts to natural systems Analyze environmental data with confidence Interpret and communicate your results to others But even more important than any specific skill, you’ll leave this course with a stronger belief in your ability to learn mathematics. Calculus is not just a hurdle to clear—it’s a tool that expands how you see and understand the world. Our hope is that by connecting it to the environment you care about, you’ll discover both its usefulness and its beauty. Most importantly, you’ll leave with the confidence to keep growing—using mathematics as a tool to explore, protect, and better understand the natural world around you. 1.6 ⚠️ A Big Disclaimer ⚠️ I started writing this textbook to create a calculus resource that speaks directly to your interests as environmental scientists. My goal is to make calculus feel relevant, supportive, and connected to the systems you care about. That said, this is very much a work in progress. This draft will have typos, rough edges, and the occasional mistake. But here’s the good news: it’s also free.  If you come across an error—big or small—please let me know so I can fix it for you and for future students. Your feedback is not just welcome, it’s essential to making this a better resource. Thanks for your patience, your sharp eyes, and your willingness to learn from (and with) an evolving text. Together, we’ll keep improving it.

Track units through computations and check results for reasonableness. Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of time and elevation. It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice. This chapter is designed to help you review and refresh the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a toolbox: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher. 2.2 What You’re Expected to Know To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with: Working with functions and interpreting graphs Manipulating algebraic equations Rules for exponents and logarithms Understanding and converting units Reading and setting up word problems If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal. This chapter is here to get you back up to speed—and to remind you that you already have more tools than you might think. 2.3 How to Approach Calculus Problems Understanding calculus isn’t about memorizing steps—it’s about learning to think mathematically so you can interpret real-world change. It’s normal for parts of this to feel unfamiliar at first; progress comes from trying, checking, and revising. In this course, we’ll model environmental systems—temperature, rainfall, population dynamics—and the goal is clarity, not perfection on the first attempt. When you get stuck, start small: sketch the situation, label axes and units, compute one example value, and say out loud what a slope or an area means in context. Treat mistakes as information, not judgment—they show you what to try next. Keep going; you’re building tools you’ll use well beyond this class. Here’s a strategy to help you become a more confident problem solver: 2.3.1 Clarify the Ask What is being asked? Is the question about a rate of change, a maximum/minimum, or an accumulated quantity? What type of function or scenario is involved (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.)? Always start by identifying what quantities are changing and how they’re related. 2.3.2 List the Givens Write down the given information clearly. Label all variables, units, and known values. If a graph or context is given, sketch or summarize what you see. Clarity in setup is half the solution. 2.3.3 Translate the Math Equations are not just symbols—they are instructions: Each term contributes to the behavior of the function. Operators (+, −, ×, ÷, …) tell you what actions to take. Derivatives tell you how the function is changing. Don’t rush through the algebra. Pause and ask: “What is this term telling me?” 2.3.4 Work Step by Step Instead of aiming straight for the final answer, focus on the process: Write out what you’re doing and why. If you take a derivative, explain what it represents (e.g., “This is the rate of change of population over time.”) Label your steps so they can be traced logically. When taking notes, don’t just copy answers. Write procedures and reasoning—this builds transferable understanding. 2.3.5 Reflect and Interpret Does your answer make sense in context? Are the units correct? Is the magnitude reasonable? What does your result say about the system you’re studying? In environmental science, the interpretation is as important as the calculation. 2.3.6 Growth Mindset You may not see math in every class you take—that’s okay. Our goal here is to build confidence and numerical literacy. Solving math problems is a step-by-step process. Thinking too far ahead can cause confusion. Take it one step at a time—that’s how you make progress. Also, try not to overthink mid-solution. If you tried to narrate every muscle movement while climbing stairs, you might trip. Trust yourself. Don’t second-guess every step—work through to the end. When you reflect, you’ll catch errors and sharpen your thinking. Confidence grows by doing. Keep moving forward—even imperfect progress builds understanding. Athletes know this: when you overanalyze your swing while swinging, performance often gets worse. Much of skilled work is partly automatic. Bringing every detail into the conscious mind can interrupt your flow. Trust your instincts. Don’t be afraid to commit to your approach. Swing through—you’ll learn more by finishing a solution than by freezing in doubt. 2.4 How We Communicate Relationships By thinking of functions as input-output machines and visualizing them on a graph, you’ll be better equipped to interpret and model relationships in environmental systems and beyond. A function represents a relationship between two quantities: an input and an output. The way we represent and communicate this is through: Verbal descriptions Graphical representations like charts Tables of data Formulas that capture the relationship Your Turn In a small group describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Write a statement describing the air temperature Graphically represent your description Create a table that represents your discussion Attempt to write an equation Now discuss the pros and cons of each of the methods. Discuss what you can and can’t do with each description of the temperature and time relationship. Discussion Prompt How does air temperature change with elevation as you hike up a mountain? Can we describe that change with a function? As you move upward through the atmosphere, the temperature typically drops at a fairly predictable rate. This is called the adiabatic lapse rate, which averages around 6.5°C per 1000 meters (or about 1°C per 154 meters). You’ll use this rule to model how the temperature changes from Seattle (sea level) to the summit of Mount Rainier (4392 m). Assume the temperature at sea level in Seattle is 18°C. Let’s use our approach to problem solving: What is the ask? What are we given? Translate the Math &amp; Work step-by-step We can translate this word problem into a table. Use the lapse rate to compute the temperature at the following elevations: Elevation (m) Temperature (°C) 0 (Seattle) 1000 2000 3000 4000 We could visualize this data by plotting these points on a graph Use R or graph paper to create a quick sketch of the temperature vs. elevation relationship. Figure 2.1: Air temperature (°C) as a function of time (hours) Finally we could attempt to write a function Use the pattern in the data to define a linear function that models temperature as a function of elevation. Let: \\(T(h)\\) = temperature at elevation \\(h\\) (in meters) Assume \\(T(0) = 18\\) and use the lapse rate to define the slope \\(T(h) =\\) Reflect and Interpret Does you answer make sense? Does it pass the sniff test? Is that what you observe when you go hiking? What does the slope of your function represent? What temperature do you predict at 4392 meters (Mount Rainier’s summit)? 2.5 Functions and Their Representations In the last activity we wrote a simple function. Now let’s take a step back and make sure we understand what functions mean and how they work. 2.5.1 Understanding What \\(f(x)\\) Means You’ve probably seen the equation of a line written like this: \\[ y = mx + b \\] This is the same as writing: \\[ f(x) = mx + b \\] Both notations describe the same relationship. Here’s what they mean: \\(x\\) is the input (what you plug into the function). \\(f(x)\\) or \\(y\\) is the output (what comes out after applying the function rule). Graphically: The input is usually plotted along the x-axis. The output (\\(y\\) or \\(f(x)\\)) is plotted along the y-axis. So when you see a point like \\((4, 11)\\), it means: Input \\(x = 4\\) produces output \\(f(x) = 11\\). A function is like a black box: you put something in, a rule is applied, and you get something out. For example: \\[ f(x) = 2x + 3 \\] If we input \\(x = 4\\): \\[ f(4) = 2 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 11 \\] So the point \\((4, 11)\\) would appear on the graph. Input: \\(x = 4\\) Rule: multiply by 2, then add 3 Output: \\(f(4) = 11\\) 2.5.2 Functions Don’t Have to Be Named \\(f\\) Functions can be named in ways that make their meaning clearer. For example: \\(T(t)\\) for temperature as a function of time \\(P(n)\\) for population as a function of years The variable also doesn’t always have to be \\(x\\). Choosing names that match the context makes your math easier to read, easier to explain, and easier to connect to the real world. 2.5.2.1 Why Meaningful Function Names Matter Suppose we want to model how land temperature T (in °C) changes with distance d (in km) from the shore. We could write the function in a very generic way: \\[ f(x) = 0.2x + 3 \\] Here, f is the temperature and x is the distance. This works mathematically, but it doesn’t tell us much about what the variables mean. A clearer way is to use variables that match the context: \\[ T(d) = 0.2d + 3 \\] Now the function communicates something immediately: \\(T(d)\\) = land temperature (°C) \\(d\\) = distance from the coast (km) This version is not only valid but more meaningful: “Temperature increases by 0.2°C for every kilometer inland, starting from 3°C at the coast.” By naming functions and variables in ways that reflect the system being studied, we make the math easier to interpret, easier to explain, and easier to apply. 2.5.3 Functions Can Have More Than One Input \\(\\, f(x,y)\\) Many environmental processes depend on more than one variable. For example, the distribution of a terrestrial species might be best described as a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where \\(x\\) is longitude and \\(y\\) is latitude. Thinking further: what would the function look like for the location of a species in three dimensions, such as mapping their position in a water column? How would you write this mathematically? In reality, many environmental systems depend on far more than three variables. When building models, the art is in simplifying: choosing the key variables that matter most for the question at hand. Including every possible factor would be too complex to work with, so we focus on what’s essential. Discussion Prompt In a group discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree. Write a pseudo-equation that takes the form of \\[ \\text{Growth} = f(\\text{Variable 1}, \\text{Variable 2}, \\ldots) \\] How many variables drive the growth of a tree? Activity: Modeling Temperature as a Function of Time and Elevation Learning Goals Understand how to construct and interpret a function of two variables. Apply environmental context to multivariable functions. Visualize how elevation impacts the daily temperature cycle using lapse rate. At sea level, the temperature throughout the day is modeled by: \\(T(t) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) [°C]\\) Temperature decreases with elevation, at a lapse rate of 6.5°C per 1000 meters: \\(L= \\frac{6.5}{1000} = 0.0065 [\\frac{°C}{m}]\\) The temperature as a function of elevation alone (assuming sea level temperature is 10°C): \\(T(h) = 10 - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) So the temperature as a function of both time t and elevation h is: \\(T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) ## time elevation temperature ## 1 6 0 10.00 ## 2 6 500 6.75 ## 3 6 1500 0.25 ## 4 12 0 15.00 ## 5 12 1000 8.50 ## 6 18 2000 -3.00 ## 7 18 5000 -22.50 Reflection: At what time of day is the temperature difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest? What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases? Does the timing of the warmest part of the day change with elevation? Stare at this equation T(t, h) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * t / 12) - 0.0065 * h, can you visualize the impact of t? what about h? The equation could have been written as f(x, y) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * x / 12) - 0.0065 * y, would this be harder to interpret? Figure 2.2: Apply the function to compute temperature 2.6 Graphing and Interpreting Change Understanding the shape of a graph is crucial for interpreting real-world phenomena. Here are key features to notice: Increasing/Decreasing: Is the function going up or down as \\(x\\) increases? Peaks and Valleys: Where are the local maxima and minima? Concavity: Does the curve bend upward (concave up) or downward (concave down)? Let’s look at an example of a quadratic function, which is commonly used to model situations with a single peak or valley. This function is an increasing function for \\(x&lt;2\\) and decreasing for \\(x&gt;2\\). It has a maximum at \\(x=2\\). We can also notice that the concavity of the function is concave down. We can also look at the how the function is changing as we move along the x axis. At \\(x=2\\) the slope of the function is positive and steep. As we approach the maximum, the slope of the function is still positive, but its not increasing as fast. We could say its increasing at a decreasing rate. At the peak, the function is not longer changing. Now as we pass \\(x=2\\) the function is decreasing slowly at first, but faster and faster as \\(x\\) gets further away from the peak. You can think of this as a ball in your hand. You throw it up, initially its moving fast, but as gravity acts on the ball it slows. Then for an instance, the ball hangs in the air - this is where it reaches its peak. Then the ball starts to fall, slowly at first, but it then begins to fall faster and faster. The calculus you will learn in this course will give you the tools needed to quatify these observations. Identify the rates of change at different point and find the maximas and minimas. 2.7 Key Function Types Here are five common functions you’ll encounter: Function Type Form Environmental Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH or sound intensity Mini Exercise Match the following environmental situations with function types: 1. Forest biomass grows rapidly, then levels off. 2. A spill’s impact decreases as you move downstream. 3. A steady rise in sea level over time. Discussion Prompt What environmental processes could you model with these functions. See if you can identify some additional real-world examples for each graph. Sketch the rough shapes of these functions and identify some of their key features? 2.8 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units are a scientist’s best friend. They don’t just tell us what we’re measuring—they also help us check if our answers make sense. In calculus, units play a central role because they give meaning to rates of change (derivatives) and accumulations (integrals). Here are some common examples in environmental science: Atmospheric CO₂ concentration is measured in ppm (parts per million). Rainfall might be reported in mm/hour. Streamflow can be given in m³/s (cubic meters per second). Tree growth might be in cm/year. 2.8.1 Why Units Matter Think of units as guardrails for problem solving: They help you avoid mistakes (e.g., mixing meters with kilometers). They give physical meaning to abstract symbols. They allow you to compare across systems and scales. If your answer has the wrong units, it’s almost certainly the wrong answer. 2.8.1.1 A Famous Example: The Mars Orbiter Mishap  In 1999, NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that cost $390 million to design, build, and launch—all because of a simple unit conversion error. One engineering team used English units (pound-seconds of force). Another team assumed metric units (Newton-seconds). The mismatch went unnoticed, and the spacecraft’s trajectory was off course. The result: the orbiter entered Mars’ atmosphere at the wrong altitude and was destroyed. This dramatic example shows why scientists and engineers obsess over units. While our classroom mistakes won’t crash a $390 million spacecraft, they can still derail your reasoning. Keeping track of units is one of the simplest—and most powerful—ways to check your work. Activity: Average Rate of Change Suppose atmospheric CO₂ increases from 400 ppm to 420 ppm over 5 years. Calculate the average rate of change Now repeat the procee but this time no numbers, run the same calculation with just the units. What do you end up with? Now tell me the sotry of what your calculation means? Reflection Questions What if we reported the time in months instead of years? How would the rate change? What if the increase had been 400 → 420 ppm in 10 years — what happens to the rate? Does “average rate” mean CO₂ increased by exactly 4 ppm every year? Why or why not? 2.8.2 Key Idea A rate of change always involves comparing how much one quantity changes relative to another. \\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Input}} \\] If the input is time, the rate tells us “how fast” something changes. If the input is distance, the rate might describe a gradient (e.g., temperature lapse rate with elevation). If the input is volume, the rate might describe a concentration per unit volume. Units don’t just check your work—they tell the story of what the math means. 2.9 Getting Comfortable with Word Problems Environmental word problems are at the heart of applying calculus. They take a real-world situation and ask you to identify the quantities involved, describe how they are changing, and build a model that captures those changes. When you read a word problem, pause and ask yourself: What is changing? (What’s the variable of interest?) How fast is it changing? (Are we talking about a rate or an accumulated total?) What influences that change? (Is it driven by time, distance, elevation, or something else?) 2.9.1 Why Word Problems Matter Anyone can compute a derivative or an integral once the equation is written down. The real challenge—and the real skill—is translating words into math. That’s what lets you use calculus to model glaciers, forests, rivers, or populations. Remember: there is no single “right” way to start. Sketching, making a table, or writing down what you know in words are all valid first steps. 2.9.2 Example Problem A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What mathematical tools would help you model this? Step 1. What’s changing? The glacier’s thickness or volume is decreasing. Step 2. How is it changing? The rate of melt is itself increasing over time. That means the rate is not constant. Step 3. What tools do we need? A derivative describes the melt rate at a given moment. An integral (this is a preview of 292) could estimate the total ice lost over a span of years. Because the rate is changing, an exponential or quadratic function might be a better fit than a linear one. Activity: Rate of change around us What other environmental situations involve a rate that changes over time (not just a constant rate)? Discuss and share back with the class How would you represent this glacier problem with a graph? With a table? If you only had measurements of ice thickness each year, how would you estimate the rate of change? 2.9.3 Key Idea Word problems are really about translation. You’re moving between: Verbal description → “the glacier is melting faster each year” Mathematical model → equations that capture this trend Interpretation → what the math tells us about the glacier and its future The math is the language, but the story is always about the system you’re studying. 2.10 Practice: Interpreting Functions 2.10.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll get more comfortable reading, interpreting, and evaluating functions — especially those that model environmental systems. You’ll see functions written in different forms (formulas, graphs, tables), and you’ll practice thinking about what the input and output represent. This is an important foundation for calculus. When we interpret derivatives later on, we’ll always come back to what is this function telling us about the real world? 2.10.2 How to Approach These Problems For any function, try answering these three questions: What are the input(s) and output? What does the function take in, and what does it give back? What do the variables represent? For example, is \\(t\\) time? Is \\(T(t)\\) a temperature? What are the units? What does the formula tell you about the relationship? If the function is increasing or decreasing, by how much? Are there any constants or slopes that describe rates? 2.10.3 Practice Problems Try these on your own or with a partner. Don’t just plug in numbers — ask what the function is saying! 2.10.3.1  Level 1: Getting Comfortable 1. Let \\(f(x) = 3x + 2\\). a. What is the input and what is the output? b. What does the function do to each input? 2. Let \\(T(t) = 20 + 0.5t\\), where \\(T(t)\\) is temperature in °C and \\(t\\) is time in hours since sunrise. a. What is the temperature at sunrise? b.

What might the graph of this function look like? c. What does it suggest about the plant’s growth? d. If you were to plug in a (very) large value for t what happens? Does the result make sense? How could you restrict this function? 6. A temperature function is defined as: \\(T(h) = 15 - 0.0065h\\), where \\(h\\) is elevation in meters. a. What is the temperature at sea level? b. How much does the temperature drop every 1000 meters? c. At what elevation will the temperature be 0°C? 2.10.3.3  Level 3: Challenging Interpretation 7. A water tank is being filled and drained at the same time. The volume of water is modeled by: \\(V(t) = 100 + 30t - 2t^2\\), where \\(V\\) is volume in liters and \\(t\\) is time in minutes. a. What kind of function is this? b. Looking at the expressions, can you explain what each term might be doing? c. Explain What happens to the volume over time?

What happens when \\(x = 0\\)? c. What happens as \\(x \\to \\infty\\)? What does that mean in context? 9. The function \\(T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) - 0.0065h\\) models temperature based on time of day \\(t\\) (in hours) and elevation \\(h\\) (in meters). a. What is the warmest time of day? b. How does elevation affect temperature? c. Which variable has a stronger effect on temperature: time or elevation? [Hint: try putting this into DESMOS to visualize] 2.11 Practice: Reading Graphs &amp; Tables 2.11.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll strengthen your ability to read and interpret visual and tabular representations of functions. In environmental science, data is often collected and communicated through graphs and tables, so being fluent in interpreting these is essential. 2.11.2 How to Approach These Problems When working with graphs or tables, try answering: What trend do you see? Is the function increasing, decreasing, leveling off, or fluctuating? What do the axes and labels tell you? What units are being used? What do the variables represent? Can you predict values not directly shown? Can you estimate an in-between value? Can you guess the shape of the full function? 2.11.3 Practice Problems Use reasoning and estimation to explore these problems. Think in terms of shape and behavior before trying to be exact. 2.11.3.1  Level 1: Getting Comfortable 1. Here is a table showing the number of insects counted in a trap each day: Day Insects 0 10 1 14 2 19 3 25 4 32 a. Is this function increasing or decreasing? b. Does the increase look linear?

What is the difference between interpolation and extrapolation? 2. The following graph shows temperature over a 24-hour period. Use the graph to answer the questions below. Figure 2.3: Practice Problems a. When is the temperature highest? b. When is it increasing most rapidly? When is decreasing most rapidly? c. Describe the concavity of this graph. c.

Figure 3.2: Empty axes for sketching height vs. time. Try to sketch the vertical position of the ball through time. When is it rising? When is it at its peak? When is it falling? How does the slope of the height vs. time graph change throughout? Notes: 3.6.4 Cubic Example Practice: Consider the function \\(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\\). Figure 3.3: Cubic function example with turning points. Where is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing? Where does it reach local maxima and minima? How does the concavity change (curving up vs curving down)? What real-world process might this model - can you tell a story? Notes: 3.6.5 Connecting Math to Environment Practice: Sketch or imagine a graph for each of these: A river’s flow during a flood event The daily temperature cycle (morning to night) The growth of algae in a lake after a nutrient spill For each: Where is it increasing/decreasing? Where would you expect peaks or valleys? How does concavity help tell the story? Notes: 3.7 Key Function Types Here are some of the most common function types you’ll see in environmental systems: Function Type Form Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing steadily over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species population growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH scale or sound intensity 3.7.1 Explore the Shapes Practice: Sketch the graphs of linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Figure 3.4: Clean blank axes without labels for sketching. How do they look different? Which ones keep increasing forever? Which ones turn around? What about curvature? Notes: 3.7.2 Match Functions to Situations Activity: Match each situation to a function type: Forest biomass after a fire The concentration of a chemical spill as you move downstream. A sea level over time. Notes: 3.7.3 Extend to Your Own Examples Discussion Prompt: Think of two environmental processes you know about (from ecology, hydrology, climate, etc.). Which function type might describe each process? What clues in the process tell you that? What would you expect the graph to look like? Notes: 3.8 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units tell the story of your math. They help you avoid mistakes, interpret results, and check reasonableness. 3.8.1 Why Units Matter Practice: Consider the formula for streamflow: \\[ Q = A \\cdot v \\] Where: - \\(Q\\) = streamflow - \\(A\\) = cross-sectional area - \\(v\\) = velocity ) Write typical units for each of the variables. Do the units on both sides of the equation match? If not, what needs to change? Notes: 3.8.2 Mars Climate Orbiter (Unit Mismatch) Prompt: A famous NASA mission failed because one team used English units and another used metric. Where in your work could a mismatch like that happen? What quick unit checks could catch it? Notes: I hope you’ve never made a mistake that cost you $300M+ 3.8.3 Average Rate of Change (CO₂ Example) Practice: Atmospheric CO₂ increases from 400 ppm to 420 ppm over 5 years. 1) Compute the average rate of change (include units). 2) Repeat without numbers — use only symbols/units. 3) Interpret: What does your rate mean in words? Notes: 3.8.4 Build a Rate From Units Only Practice: You measure rainfall in mm over hours. Form a meaningful rainfall rate using just the units (no numbers). What does that rate tell you physically? Think of situations where that rate would be useful. Notes: 3.8.5 Rate Sense-Check Prompt: You computed a melt rate of a glacier as 3 m/day. Is that reasonable? Why or why not? What additional context would help you check it? Propose a more plausible order of magnitude and justify it. Notes: 3.8.6 Word Problem → Math → Story Practice: “A lake’s algae concentration rises by a constant amount each day.” Define variables with units. Write a simple function that models this. Compute the average rate over a week. Tell the story of your function in plain English. Notes: 3.9 Getting Comfortable with Word Problems Word problems are about translation: turning words into math and then back into real-world meaning. 3.9.1 Reading Word Problems 3.9.2 Glacier Example Practice: A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What’s changing? Is the rate constant or variable? What kind of function might model this (linear, quadratic, exponential)? What would a graph of this look like? Notes: 3.9.3 Build Your Own Word Problem Activity: Think of another environmental situation where the rate of change itself is changing. Write your own short word problem and sketch how you’d model it. Notes: 3.10 Skills Drills These drills are for extra practice.
