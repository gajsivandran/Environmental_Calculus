Welcome to Calculus for Environmental Science.  This book is your companion for exploring the natural world through the lens of calculus—especially the powerful ideas of change and accumulation. You’ll find that calculus is not just about symbols on a page—it’s about asking meaningful questions, interpreting patterns, and making sense of complex environmental systems. And along the way, you’ll see that you are absolutely capable of mastering these ideas. 1.1 Why This Book? Most calculus textbooks lean heavily on physics examples—motion, velocity, and acceleration—because calculus was originally developed to solve physics problems. Those examples are powerful, and we’ll use them from time to time because they give us an intuitive “feel” for how change works. But today, calculus is a tool used across many disciplines: biology, ecology, environmental science, economics, engineering, and beyond. In this book, we’ll focus on examples that resonate with your studies and your interests as an environmental scientist. Environmental scientists face some of the most urgent and complex challenges of our time—climate change, biodiversity loss, resource management, and pollution. Calculus gives us tools to: Predict how systems evolve over time Estimate impacts and risks Model natural and human systems with differential equations Analyze rates of change and long-term accumulation Throughout this book, you’ll work with real environmental data, use visual and conceptual approaches, and practice skills that matter for sustainability. Our goal is not just to “get through calculus,” but to see how these mathematical ideas open doors for discovery and problem-solving in the real world. 1.2 What Is Calculus? At its heart, calculus is the mathematics of change and accumulation. These two ideas are everywhere in science: The rate of CO₂ increase in the atmosphere is a derivative. The total added CO₂ over a year is an integral. Traditionally, calculus is first introduced through physics examples like velocity (rate of change of position) and acceleration (rate of change of velocity). These are helpful because most of us can feel what it means to move faster or slower. We’ll use those examples when they make ideas clearer. But throughout this book, our main goal is to connect calculus directly to the environment you are studying. You’ll see derivatives and integrals applied to population growth, forest carbon storage, water flow in rivers, and other natural systems. We’ll build your understanding of these concepts step by step, supported by graphs, data, and hands-on examples. And if it’s been a while since your last math class, that’s completely okay—you’ll find plenty of support here. We’ll meet you where you are and grow your skills together. Change is Everywhere In a small group, discuss where change could be happening in this image? 1.3 How This Book Works Each chapter is designed to support you as a learner. You’ll find: Clear explanations of key concepts Environmental examples to connect math with meaning Practice problems to strengthen your skills Reflection prompts to help you think about what you’re learning 1.4 Success in This Class First and foremost, know this: we believe in your ability to learn and grow. You bring unique strengths and perspectives, and your effort matters here. Mistakes are not a setback—they are the very heart of learning. When you get something wrong, you uncover where your thinking needs refinement, and that creates the space for real growth. Struggle is not a sign you don’t belong; it’s proof that your brain is stretching and building new connections. Just like in science, learning calculus is about iteration—trying, testing, revising, and improving. That process is what makes your understanding deeper and more durable. Assessments in this class are snapshots of your thinking at a particular moment in time. They are not final judgments about your intelligence, your worth, or your potential. You will have chances to revisit concepts, refine your understanding, and demonstrate what you’ve learned. Growth comes from re-engaging with the material, not from perfection on the first try. So give yourself permission to be imperfect. Keep engaging, reflecting, and asking questions. We’ll be here to support you every step of the way. 1.5 Looking Ahead By the end of this course, you will be able to: Apply calculus concepts to natural systems Analyze environmental data with confidence Interpret and communicate your results to others But even more important than any specific skill, you’ll leave this course with a stronger belief in your ability to learn mathematics. Calculus is not just a hurdle to clear—it’s a tool that expands how you see and understand the world. Our hope is that by connecting it to the environment you care about, you’ll discover both its usefulness and its beauty. Most importantly, you’ll leave with the confidence to keep growing—using mathematics as a tool to explore, protect, and better understand the natural world around you. 1.6 ⚠️ A Big Disclaimer ⚠️ I started writing this textbook to create a calculus resource that speaks directly to your interests as environmental scientists. My goal is to make calculus feel relevant, supportive, and connected to the systems you care about. That said, this is very much a work in progress. This draft will have typos, rough edges, and the occasional mistake. But here’s the good news: it’s also free.  If you come across an error—big or small—please let me know so I can fix it for you and for future students. Your feedback is not just welcome, it’s essential to making this a better resource. Thanks for your patience, your sharp eyes, and your willingness to learn from (and with) an evolving text. Together, we’ll keep improving it.

Track units through computations and check results for reasonableness. Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of time and elevation. It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice. This chapter is designed to help you review and refresh the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a toolbox: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher. 2.2 What You’re Expected to Know To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with: Working with functions and interpreting graphs Manipulating algebraic equations Rules for exponents and logarithms Understanding and converting units Reading and setting up word problems If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal. This chapter is here to get you back up to speed—and to remind you that you already have more tools than you might think. 2.3 How to Approach Calculus Problems Understanding calculus isn’t about memorizing steps—it’s about learning to think mathematically so you can interpret real-world change. It’s normal for parts of this to feel unfamiliar at first; progress comes from trying, checking, and revising. In this course, we’ll model environmental systems—temperature, rainfall, population dynamics—and the goal is clarity, not perfection on the first attempt. When you get stuck, start small: sketch the situation, label axes and units, compute one example value, and say out loud what a slope or an area means in context. Treat mistakes as information, not judgment—they show you what to try next. Keep going; you’re building tools you’ll use well beyond this class. Here’s a strategy to help you become a more confident problem solver: 2.3.1 Clarify the Ask What is being asked? Is the question about a rate of change, a maximum/minimum, or an accumulated quantity? What type of function or scenario is involved (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.)? Always start by identifying what quantities are changing and how they’re related. 2.3.2 List the Givens Write down the given information clearly. Label all variables, units, and known values. If a graph or context is given, sketch or summarize what you see. Clarity in setup is half the solution. 2.3.3 Translate the Math Equations are not just symbols—they are instructions: Each term contributes to the behavior of the function. Operators (+, −, ×, ÷, …) tell you what actions to take. Derivatives tell you how the function is changing. Don’t rush through the algebra. Pause and ask: “What is this term telling me?” 2.3.4 Work Step by Step Instead of aiming straight for the final answer, focus on the process: Write out what you’re doing and why. If you take a derivative, explain what it represents (e.g., “This is the rate of change of population over time.”) Label your steps so they can be traced logically. When taking notes, don’t just copy answers. Write procedures and reasoning—this builds transferable understanding. 2.3.5 Reflect and Interpret Does your answer make sense in context? Are the units correct? Is the magnitude reasonable? What does your result say about the system you’re studying? In environmental science, the interpretation is as important as the calculation. 2.3.6 Growth Mindset You may not see math in every class you take—that’s okay. Our goal here is to build confidence and numerical literacy. Solving math problems is a step-by-step process. Thinking too far ahead can cause confusion. Take it one step at a time—that’s how you make progress. Also, try not to overthink mid-solution. If you tried to narrate every muscle movement while climbing stairs, you might trip. Trust yourself. Don’t second-guess every step—work through to the end. When you reflect, you’ll catch errors and sharpen your thinking. Confidence grows by doing. Keep moving forward—even imperfect progress builds understanding. Athletes know this: when you overanalyze your swing while swinging, performance often gets worse. Much of skilled work is partly automatic. Bringing every detail into the conscious mind can interrupt your flow. Trust your instincts. Don’t be afraid to commit to your approach. Swing through—you’ll learn more by finishing a solution than by freezing in doubt. 2.4 How We Communicate Relationships By thinking of functions as input-output machines and visualizing them on a graph, you’ll be better equipped to interpret and model relationships in environmental systems and beyond. A function represents a relationship between two quantities: an input and an output. The way we represent and communicate this is through: Verbal descriptions Graphical representations like charts Tables of data Formulas that capture the relationship Your Turn In a small group describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Write a statement describing the air temperature Graphically represent your description Create a table that represents your discussion Attempt to write an equation Now discuss the pros and cons of each of the methods. Discuss what you can and can’t do with each description of the temperature and time relationship. Discussion Prompt How does air temperature change with elevation as you hike up a mountain? Can we describe that change with a function? As you move upward through the atmosphere, the temperature typically drops at a fairly predictable rate. This is called the adiabatic lapse rate, which averages around 6.5°C per 1000 meters (or about 1°C per 154 meters). You’ll use this rule to model how the temperature changes from Seattle (sea level) to the summit of Mount Rainier (4392 m). Assume the temperature at sea level in Seattle is 18°C. Let’s use our approach to problem solving: What is the ask? What are we given? Translate the Math &amp; Work step-by-step We can translate this word problem into a table. Use the lapse rate to compute the temperature at the following elevations: Elevation (m) Temperature (°C) 0 (Seattle) 1000 2000 3000 4000 We could visualize this data by plotting these points on a graph Use R or graph paper to create a quick sketch of the temperature vs. elevation relationship. Figure 2.1: Air temperature (degC) as a function of time (hours) Finally we could attempt to write a function Use the pattern in the data to define a linear function that models temperature as a function of elevation. Let: \\(T(h)\\) = temperature at elevation \\(h\\) (in meters) Assume \\(T(0) = 18\\) and use the lapse rate to define the slope \\(T(h) =\\) Reflect and Interpret Does you answer make sense? Does it pass the sniff test? Is that what you observe when you go hiking? What does the slope of your function represent? What temperature do you predict at 4392 meters (Mount Rainier’s summit)? 2.5 Functions and Their Representations In the last activity we wrote a simple function. Now let’s take a step back and make sure we understand what functions mean and how they work. 2.5.1 Understanding What \\(f(x)\\) Means You’ve probably seen the equation of a line written like this: \\[ y = mx + b \\] This is the same as writing: \\[ f(x) = mx + b \\] Both notations describe the same relationship. Here’s what they mean: \\(x\\) is the input (what you plug into the function). \\(f(x)\\) or \\(y\\) is the output (what comes out after applying the function rule). Graphically: The input is usually plotted along the x-axis. The output (\\(y\\) or \\(f(x)\\)) is plotted along the y-axis. So when you see a point like \\((4, 11)\\), it means: Input \\(x = 4\\) produces output \\(f(x) = 11\\). A function is like a black box: you put something in, a rule is applied, and you get something out. For example: \\[ f(x) = 2x + 3 \\] If we input \\(x = 4\\): \\[ f(4) = 2 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 11 \\] So the point \\((4, 11)\\) would appear on the graph. Input: \\(x = 4\\) Rule: multiply by 2, then add 3 Output: \\(f(4) = 11\\) 2.5.2 Functions Don’t Have to Be Named \\(f\\) Functions can be named in ways that make their meaning clearer. For example: \\(T(t)\\) for temperature as a function of time \\(P(n)\\) for population as a function of years The variable also doesn’t always have to be \\(x\\). Choosing names that match the context makes your math easier to read, easier to explain, and easier to connect to the real world. 2.5.2.1 Why Meaningful Function Names Matter Suppose we want to model how land temperature T (in °C) changes with distance d (in km) from the shore. We could write the function in a very generic way: \\[ f(x) = 0.2x + 3 \\] Here, f is the temperature and x is the distance. This works mathematically, but it doesn’t tell us much about what the variables mean. A clearer way is to use variables that match the context: \\[ T(d) = 0.2d + 3 \\] Now the function communicates something immediately: \\(T(d)\\) = land temperature (°C) \\(d\\) = distance from the coast (km) This version is not only valid but more meaningful: “Temperature increases by 0.2°C for every kilometer inland, starting from 3°C at the coast.” By naming functions and variables in ways that reflect the system being studied, we make the math easier to interpret, easier to explain, and easier to apply. 2.5.3 Functions Can Have More Than One Input \\(\\, f(x,y)\\) Many environmental processes depend on more than one variable. For example, the distribution of a terrestrial species might be best described as a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where \\(x\\) is longitude and \\(y\\) is latitude. Thinking further: what would the function look like for the location of a species in three dimensions, such as mapping their position in a water column? How would you write this mathematically? In reality, many environmental systems depend on far more than three variables. When building models, the art is in simplifying: choosing the key variables that matter most for the question at hand. Including every possible factor would be too complex to work with, so we focus on what’s essential. Discussion Prompt In a group discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree. Write a pseudo-equation that takes the form of \\[ \\text{Growth} = f(\\text{Variable 1}, \\text{Variable 2}, \\ldots) \\] How many variables drive the growth of a tree? Activity: Modeling Temperature as a Function of Time and Elevation Learning Goals Understand how to construct and interpret a function of two variables. Apply environmental context to multivariable functions. Visualize how elevation impacts the daily temperature cycle using lapse rate. At sea level, the temperature throughout the day is modeled by: \\(T(t) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) [°C]\\) Temperature decreases with elevation, at a lapse rate of 6.5°C per 1000 meters: \\(L= \\frac{6.5}{1000} = 0.0065 [\\frac{°C}{m}]\\) The temperature as a function of elevation alone (assuming sea level temperature is 10°C): \\(T(h) = 10 - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) So the temperature as a function of both time t and elevation h is: \\(T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) ## time elevation temperature ## 1 6 0 10.00 ## 2 6 500 6.75 ## 3 6 1500 0.25 ## 4 12 0 15.00 ## 5 12 1000 8.50 ## 6 18 2000 -3.00 ## 7 18 5000 -22.50 Reflection: At what time of day is the temperature difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest? What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases? Does the timing of the warmest part of the day change with elevation? Stare at this equation T(t, h) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * t / 12) - 0.0065 * h, can you visualize the impact of t? what about h? The equation could have been written as f(x, y) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * x / 12) - 0.0065 * y, would this be harder to interpret? Figure 2.2: Apply the function to compute temperature 2.6 Graphing and Interpreting Change Understanding the shape of a graph is crucial for interpreting real-world phenomena. Here are key features to notice: Increasing/Decreasing: Is the function going up or down as \\(x\\) increases? Peaks and Valleys: Where are the local maxima and minima? Concavity: Does the curve bend upward (concave up) or downward (concave down)? Let’s look at an example of a quadratic function, which is commonly used to model situations with a single peak or valley. This function is an increasing function for \\(x&lt;2\\) and decreasing for \\(x&gt;2\\). It has a maximum at \\(x=2\\). We can also notice that the concavity of the function is concave down. We can also look at the how the function is changing as we move along the x axis. At \\(x=2\\) the slope of the function is positive and steep. As we approach the maximum, the slope of the function is still positive, but its not increasing as fast. We could say its increasing at a decreasing rate. At the peak, the function is not longer changing. Now as we pass \\(x=2\\) the function is decreasing slowly at first, but faster and faster as \\(x\\) gets further away from the peak. You can think of this as a ball in your hand. You throw it up, initially its moving fast, but as gravity acts on the ball it slows. Then for an instance, the ball hangs in the air - this is where it reaches its peak. Then the ball starts to fall, slowly at first, but it then begins to fall faster and faster. The calculus you will learn in this course will give you the tools needed to quatify these observations. Identify the rates of change at different point and find the maximas and minimas. 2.7 Key Function Types Here are five common functions you’ll encounter: Function Type Form Environmental Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH or sound intensity Mini Exercise Match the following environmental situations with function types: 1. Forest biomass grows rapidly, then levels off. 2. A spill’s impact decreases as you move downstream. 3. A steady rise in sea level over time. Discussion Prompt What environmental processes could you model with these functions. See if you can identify some additional real-world examples for each graph. Sketch the rough shapes of these functions and identify some of their key features? 2.8 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units are a scientist’s best friend. They don’t just tell us what we’re measuring—they also help us check if our answers make sense. In calculus, units play a central role because they give meaning to rates of change (derivatives) and accumulations (integrals). Here are some common examples in environmental science: Atmospheric CO₂ concentration is measured in ppm (parts per million). Rainfall might be reported in mm/hour. Streamflow can be given in m³/s (cubic meters per second). Tree growth might be in cm/year. 2.8.1 Why Units Matter Think of units as guardrails for problem solving: They help you avoid mistakes (e.g., mixing meters with kilometers). They give physical meaning to abstract symbols. They allow you to compare across systems and scales. If your answer has the wrong units, it’s almost certainly the wrong answer. 2.8.1.1 A Famous Example: The Mars Orbiter Mishap  In 1999, NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that cost $390 million to design, build, and launch—all because of a simple unit conversion error. One engineering team used English units (pound-seconds of force). Another team assumed metric units (Newton-seconds). The mismatch went unnoticed, and the spacecraft’s trajectory was off course. The result: the orbiter entered Mars’ atmosphere at the wrong altitude and was destroyed. This dramatic example shows why scientists and engineers obsess over units. While our classroom mistakes won’t crash a $390 million spacecraft, they can still derail your reasoning. Keeping track of units is one of the simplest—and most powerful—ways to check your work. Activity: Average Rate of Change Suppose atmospheric CO₂ increases from 400 ppm to 420 ppm over 5 years. Calculate the average rate of change Now repeat the procee but this time no numbers, run the same calculation with just the units. What do you end up with? Now tell me the sotry of what your calculation means? Reflection Questions What if we reported the time in months instead of years? How would the rate change? What if the increase had been 400 → 420 ppm in 10 years — what happens to the rate? Does “average rate” mean CO₂ increased by exactly 4 ppm every year? Why or why not? 2.8.2 Key Idea A rate of change always involves comparing how much one quantity changes relative to another. \\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Input}} \\] If the input is time, the rate tells us “how fast” something changes. If the input is distance, the rate might describe a gradient (e.g., temperature lapse rate with elevation). If the input is volume, the rate might describe a concentration per unit volume. Units don’t just check your work—they tell the story of what the math means. 2.9 Getting Comfortable with Word Problems Environmental word problems are at the heart of applying calculus. They take a real-world situation and ask you to identify the quantities involved, describe how they are changing, and build a model that captures those changes. When you read a word problem, pause and ask yourself: What is changing? (What’s the variable of interest?) How fast is it changing? (Are we talking about a rate or an accumulated total?) What influences that change? (Is it driven by time, distance, elevation, or something else?) 2.9.1 Why Word Problems Matter Anyone can compute a derivative or an integral once the equation is written down. The real challenge—and the real skill—is translating words into math. That’s what lets you use calculus to model glaciers, forests, rivers, or populations. Remember: there is no single “right” way to start. Sketching, making a table, or writing down what you know in words are all valid first steps. 2.9.2 Example Problem A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What mathematical tools would help you model this? Step 1. What’s changing? The glacier’s thickness or volume is decreasing. Step 2. How is it changing? The rate of melt is itself increasing over time. That means the rate is not constant. Step 3. What tools do we need? A derivative describes the melt rate at a given moment. An integral (this is a preview of 292) could estimate the total ice lost over a span of years. Because the rate is changing, an exponential or quadratic function might be a better fit than a linear one. Activity: Rate of change around us What other environmental situations involve a rate that changes over time (not just a constant rate)? Discuss and share back with the class How would you represent this glacier problem with a graph? With a table? If you only had measurements of ice thickness each year, how would you estimate the rate of change? 2.9.3 Key Idea Word problems are really about translation. You’re moving between: Verbal description → “the glacier is melting faster each year” Mathematical model → equations that capture this trend Interpretation → what the math tells us about the glacier and its future The math is the language, but the story is always about the system you’re studying. 2.10 Practice: Interpreting Functions 2.10.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll get more comfortable reading, interpreting, and evaluating functions — especially those that model environmental systems. You’ll see functions written in different forms (formulas, graphs, tables), and you’ll practice thinking about what the input and output represent. This is an important foundation for calculus. When we interpret derivatives later on, we’ll always come back to what is this function telling us about the real world? 2.10.2 How to Approach These Problems For any function, try answering these three questions: What are the input(s) and output? What does the function take in, and what does it give back? What do the variables represent? For example, is \\(t\\) time? Is \\(T(t)\\) a temperature? What are the units? What does the formula tell you about the relationship? If the function is increasing or decreasing, by how much? Are there any constants or slopes that describe rates? 2.10.3 Practice Problems Try these on your own or with a partner. Don’t just plug in numbers — ask what the function is saying!

What might the graph of this function look like? c. What does it suggest about the plant’s growth? d. If you were to plug in a (very) large value for t what happens? Does the result make sense? How could you restrict this function? 6. A temperature function is defined as: \\(T(h) = 15 - 0.0065h\\), where \\(h\\) is elevation in meters above sea level. a. What is the temperature at sea level? b. How much does the temperature drop every 1000 meters? c. At what elevation will the temperature be 0°C?  Level 3: Challenging Interpretation 7. A water tank is being filled and drained at the same time. The volume of water is modeled by: \\(V(t) = 100 + 30t - 2t^2\\), where \\(V\\) is volume in liters and \\(t\\) is time in minutes. a. What kind of function is this? b. Looking at the expressions, can you explain what each term might be doing? c. Explain What happens to the volume over time?

What happens when \\(x = 0\\)? c. What happens as \\(x \\to \\infty\\)? What does that mean in context? 9.

What is the warmest time of day? b. How does elevation affect temperature? c. Which variable has a stronger effect on temperature: time or elevation? [Hint: try putting this into DESMOS to visualize] 2.11 Practice: Reading Graphs &amp; Tables 2.11.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll strengthen your ability to read and interpret visual and tabular representations of functions. In environmental science, data is often collected and communicated through graphs and tables, so being fluent in interpreting these is essential. 2.11.2 How to Approach These Problems When working with graphs or tables, try answering: What trend do you see? Is the function increasing, decreasing, leveling off, or fluctuating? What do the axes and labels tell you? What units are being used? What do the variables represent? Can you predict values not directly shown? Can you estimate an in-between value? Can you guess the shape of the full function? 2.11.3 Practice Problems Use reasoning and estimation to explore these problems. Think in terms of shape and behavior before trying to be exact.  Level 1: Getting Comfortable 1. Here is a table showing the number of insects counted in a trap each day: Day Insects 0 10 1 14 2 19 3 25 4 32 a.

You’ll learn how to: Identify input and output variables Write clear, meaningful function names Move between verbal descriptions, tables, graphs, and equations 2.12.2 How to Approach These Problems When you’re given a word problem, follow these steps: Identify what’s changing Is the input time? Distance? Elevation? Define your variables Choose names that make sense — like \\(G(t)\\) for glacier thickness or \\(T(h)\\) for temperature at elevation. Look for rates or starting values Most real-world functions are built from a starting point and a rate of change. Build the equation Most problems can be written as: \\[ \\text{Output} = \\text{Starting Value} \\pm \\text{Rate} \\cdot \\text{Input} \\] Example A glacier melts by 1.2 meters per year.

Interpret the meaning of a derivative from graphs, data, and equations. Apply derivative notation and connect it to environmental contexts. Solve practice problems and apply derivatives to real-world examples. 3.2 Understanding The Speed Of Change Imagine you’re a marine biologist monitoring the population of a reef-dwelling fish species in a protected area. Over the past five years, the fish population has started to rebound after a ban on commercial fishing. But the key question isn’t just how many fish are there now?—it’s how fast is the population recovering? Or picture a team of conservationists tracking the spread of an invasive plant through a national park. The plant’s total coverage increases each month—but is that rate speeding up, slowing down, or holding steady? These are not just ecological observations. They’re questions about change. And answering them requires calculus. 3.3 Why We Need New Math Tools Environmental systems are dynamic. They change in space and time, often unpredictably. To understand them, we don’t just need to measure things—we need to describe how those things change: How fast is a species’ population growing or shrinking? At what rate is temperature increasing in alpine ecosystems? How steeply is oxygen concentration decreasing with depth in a lake? When does the tide rise the fastest? These are all examples of rates of change, and they are the foundation of the derivative. 3.4 What You’ll Learn in This Chapter In this chapter, you’ll build your intuition for what a derivative represents. We’ll explore: The difference between average and instantaneous change How to interpret a derivative from a graph Real examples where rates of change matter The mathematical notation that lets us describe and work with change You’ll also work with data—like fish populations, temperature profiles, and environmental time series—to see how derivatives emerge from patterns and graphs. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to look at a system and say not just what is happening, but how fast is it happening—and in which direction? That’s the power of the derivative. 3.5 What Is A Derivative? You’ve probably seen derivatives before—even if you didn’t call them that. If you’ve ever looked at how fast something was growing, declining, or shifting in space or time, you’ve already been thinking about derivatives. Table 3.1: Terms Across Disciplines That Represent Derivatives Math…Physics…Data…Context Environmental…Applied…Context Rate of change Growth rate Slope of the tangent line Decay rate Instantaneous rate Reaction rate Velocity Flux Acceleration Turnover rate Gradient Loss rate / Gain rate Marginal change Change per unit time Slope at a point Response rate Rise over run Uptake rate Delta Y / Delta X First difference Mathematically, the derivative describes the instantaneous rate of change—the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point. 3.5.1 Derivative Notation: Speaking the Language of Change In calculus, there are several common notations used to represent the derivative—the instantaneous rate of change of a function. Understanding these notations is key to reading and writing mathematics fluently, especially when interpreting real-world problems in environmental science. 3.5.1.1 Common Derivative Notations Let’s say we have a function, we could right this as: \\[ f(x) = something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\\\ y= something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\] We can then write the notation of the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) in several ways, all of which mean exactly the same thing: Notation Spoken As Description \\(f&#39;(x)\\) “f prime of x” Most compact form; often used in textbooks \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) “dee y over dee x” Emphasizes that \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\); Leibniz notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\) “dee by dee x of f of x” Shows that differentiation is an operation \\(D_x f(x)\\) “D sub x of f of x” Operator form used in some texts \\(y&#39;\\) “y prime” Used when \\(y = f(x)\\), common in applied settings Prime notation: e.g., \\(f&#39;(x)\\), \\(g&#39;(t)\\) Leibniz notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\), \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) Operator notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))\\), applying \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) to an expression 3.5.1.2 The Derivative as an Operator The notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is not just a symbol—it’s an operator. That means it acts on a function to produce another function: the derivative. Think of it this way: The symbol \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is a command: “Take the derivative of whatever comes after this with respect to \\(x\\).” So if you write: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) \\] You are instructing the reader (or yourself!) to differentiate the expression \\(3x^2 + 2x\\) with respect to \\(x\\). The result: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) = 6x + 2 \\] 3.6 Average Rate of Change Discussion Prompt Think about a population of salmon in a river system. Suppose the number of salmon increases steadily over a migration season. How could we describe how fast the population is changing? The average rate of change of a quantity tells us how much that quantity changes per unit of time (or distance, or any other input variable). It’s a way to summarize how something is increasing or decreasing over an interval, even if the actual change isn’t perfectly steady throughout. Mathematically, the average rate of change of a function \\(f(x)\\) between two points \\(x = a\\) and \\(x = b\\) is: \\[ \\text{Average Rate of Change} = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \\] This is the rise over run formula you’ve likely used in algebra. It gives us the slope of the secant line connecting the two points on a graph. 3.6.1 Environmental Example: Ocean Temperature Let’s say ocean surface temperature is modeled by a function \\(T(t)\\), where \\(t\\) is time in months and \\(T(t)\\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius. Suppose: In June (\\(t = 6\\)), the temperature is \\(T(6) = 13^\\circ C\\) In September (\\(t = 9\\)), the temperature is \\(T(9) = 16^\\circ C\\) The average rate of temperature change from June to September is: \\[ \\frac{T(9) - T(6)}{9 - 6} = \\frac{16 - 13}{3} = 1^\\circ C \\text{ per month} \\] Interpretation: On average, the ocean surface temperature increased by 1°C per month during this time. 3.6.2 More Examples from Environmental Science Goal: Practice identifying real-world situations where average rate of change is meaningful. Step 1: Review Examples Together Here are some examples of average rate of change in environmental contexts: Carbon Emissions: Change in CO₂ levels over decades.

What does that suggest about the acceleration of sea level rise? Connect to Derivatives If this were a smooth function \\(S(t)\\) representing sea level at year \\(t\\), what would the derivative \\(S&#39;(t)\\) represent? What would a plot of the average rate of change look like? What would happen if we looked at the average rate of change over shorter and shorter periods? How would this chang the way a plot of the rate of change look like? Reflection Prompt Describe a situation in your area of interest (marine biology, forestry, climate science, etc.) where an average rate of change is used. What does it tell you, and what might it leave out? 3.7 Instantaneous Rate of Change: Zooming In In the last section, you estimated the average rate of sea level rise over several 5-year periods. But what if we want to know how fast sea level was rising at one specific moment—say, in the year 2010? That’s where the instantaneous rate of change comes in. It answers the question: How fast is something changing right now? This is the essence of what we mean by the derivative in calculus. 3.7.1 From Averages to Instants Think back to the graph of sea level rise: The average rate over a time interval is the slope of a secant line connecting two points. The instantaneous rate at a single point is the slope of the tangent line at that point. You can imagine drawing shorter and shorter secant lines—where the two points move closer together. As the interval shrinks, the slope of the secant approaches the slope of the tangent. This limiting process—zooming in on a curve until the “average” becomes the “instant”—is the central idea of the derivative. 3.7.2 Environmental Meaning In sea level terms, the instantaneous rate tells us: How fast sea level is rising at a specific year (e.g., 2010). Whether that rate is speeding up (acceleration) or slowing down. Similar questions appear across environmental science: How fast is a glacier front retreating today? How quickly is a species’ population growing right now compared to 10 years ago? What is the current rate of deforestation in a region? Understanding these instantaneous rates of change allows scientists to: Model dynamic systems more accurately. Make predictions about future change. Take action at the moments when it matters most. 3.7.3 Activity: Environmental Meaning of Instantaneous Change Goal: Connect the mathematical idea of instantaneous rate of change to an animal’s life history — and begin to think about how that rate itself can change. Step 1: Predict Together (2 minutes) Imagine tracking the weight of a bear over its entire lifetime. Sketch or imagine what you think the weight vs. age graph might look like. Where do you think the curve is steepest? Flat? Could it ever slope downward? Step 2: Small Group Brainstorm (5 minutes) In groups of 2–3 discuss 1. What does the instantaneous rate of weight change represent biologically at different stages? 2. Where is the bear gaining weight faster and faster (accelerating)? 3. Where is the bear still gaining weight, but more slowly (decelerating)? 4. Why might wildlife managers care about not only the rate of change, but whether that rate itself is increasing or decreasing? Step 3: Share &amp; Compare (5 minutes) Each group shares one insight. Compare across groups: At which ages would the rate of weight gain likely be accelerating? When would it be slowing down? When might the rate even become negative? Discuss: Why does knowing the rate of change of the rate of change add more insight than the rate alone? Step 4: Individual Reflection (2 minutes) Think of another lifetime pattern in an organism: What is changing across the lifetime? At what stage is growth accelerating? At what stage is growth decelerating? What decisions or actions could this second layer of information support (e.g., timing of reproduction, monitoring health decline, conservation priorities)? 3.8 The Limit Definition of a Derivative In calculus, a limit is a tool we use to understand what happens to a function as we get closer and closer to a specific point—even if we can’t plug in that point directly. Don’t worry if limits feel abstract at first—we’ll build the idea step by step with words, graphs, and formulas. 3.8.1 Intuition Suppose you were camping on the beach next to the Pacific Ocean on the 4th of July. You may not know the exact rate of sea level change on that day, but you could estimate the average rate of change nearby—for example, by comparing the sea level on July 3rd and July 4th. A limit takes this idea even further. Instead of looking at an average over whole days, we imagine shrinking the time interval smaller and smaller—so small that the “average period” is tending toward zero. In that process, we arrive at the instantaneous rate of change: how fast sea level is changing at that exact moment. 3.8.2 Why Do We Need Limits? Environmental systems are often continuous and messy for example air temperature, pollution levels, or population growth. To explore questions such as: How fast is a glacier melting right now? What is the rate of deforestation at the edge of a forest? How quickly is sea level rising at a given year? …we need a mathematical tool that captures behavior as we “zoom in.” That tool is the limit. 3.8.3 Visual Intuition As you zoom in on a curve—say, sea level rise over time—it begins to look straight. The slope of that straight line is the instantaneous rate of change. The limit formalizes this process of zooming in infinitely close. Activity: Zooming in on a Curve Goal: Explore how zooming in around a single point makes any curve begin to look like a straight line. Step 1: Observe the Panels (2 minutes) Look at the 4-panel figure: Panel 1 shows the full curve. Panels 2–4 zoom in closer and closer around a single point. Question: What changes as we zoom in? What stays the same? Step 2: Compare the Curve and the Line (5 minutes) In Panels 2–4 you see both the curve and the tangent line at the chosen point. How do the curve and tangent look different in Panel 2? By Panel 4, what do you notice about how closely the curve and the tangent overlap? Step 3: Make a Prediction (3 minutes) If we zoomed in even further (say, Panel 5, Panel 6…), what would you expect to see? Would you still be able to tell the difference between the curve and the line? Step 4: Generalize the Idea (5 minutes) Discuss in pairs or small groups: Do you think this would only work for this one curve, or for any smooth (continous) curve? What does this suggest about the nature of curves when we zoom in enough? Step 5: Reflection (2 minutes) Write down your own words to complete this sentence: When you zoom in close enough on any smooth curve, it starts to look like a ________. Takeaway: This activity shows that every smooth curve looks linear when you zoom in far enough. That’s why we use tangent lines and derivatives in calculus—to capture the local linear behavior of a curve. 3.8.4 Mathematical Notation A limit is written as: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\] Read aloud: “The limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\).” It asks: What value does \\(f(x)\\) get closer and closer to as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to \\(a\\)? Notice: this may or may not equal \\(f(a)\\) or in other words, we closer to \\(a\\) but never actually get there. 3.8.5 Example: A hole in a function Let’s say we have a function below and are interested at what the value of the function is at \\(x=1\\): \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] At first glance, if we try to plug in \\(x = 1\\), we get: \\[ f(1) = \\frac{1^2 - 1}{1 - 1} = \\frac{0}{0} \\] This is undefined! But we can still ask: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] Factoring the numerator: \\[ \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = \\frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1} \\] As long as \\(x \\ne 1\\), the \\(x - 1\\) cancels out: \\[ f(x) = x + 1 \\] So as \\(x \\to 1\\), \\(f(x) \\to 2\\). Even though \\(f(1)\\) is undefined, the limit exists: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = 2 \\] Graphically we can see the function doesn’t exist at \\(x=1\\), which we depict as an open circle. But we can still ask, what function value do we approach as we get close to 2. 3.8.6 Estimating a limit In some cases it may not be possible to factor like the example above. So how could you get an idea of the limit. Lets introduce the idea of estimating the limit. If we write the limit again adn ask ourselves what is this mathematical statement asking: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] If is asking, what it the value of the function as x gets closer and closer to \\(1\\). So what if we let \\(x\\) get really really close. Let x= 0.9 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.9^2-1}{0.9-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.19}{-0.1} \\approx 1.9 \\] Notice we are using the approximate symbol (\\(\\approx\\)) to show that we are estimating. What is we get closer still to \\(x=1\\). Let x= 0.99 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.99^2-1}{0.99-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.0199}{-0.01} \\approx 1.99 \\] We seem to be getting closer and close to the the value we expect. Lets get really small now. Let x= 0.999999 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.999999^2-1}{0.999999-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.00000199}{-0.000001} \\approx 1.999999 \\] Note: Be careful when doing this on your calculator, it is easy to forget a digit on the numerator or a denominator, and if you do your answer may be too big or too small. 3.8.7 One-Sided Limits Sometimes, its helpful to examine what is happening as we approach a point fomr both directions directios. In the previous example we apprach from the left (or the negative) side of the point. Left-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) \\] — from values less than \\(a\\) Right-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] — from values greater than \\(a\\) You can think about this as what is the value of the function a little bit to the left and right of the point we are approaching. Extending the example above if we approached from the right \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{1.000001^2-1}{1.000001-1} \\approx \\frac{0.000002000001}{0.000001} \\approx 2.000001 \\] If the left-hand and right-hand limits agree, then the overall limit exists. So in the previous example a limit exists at \\(x=1\\) and that limit is 2. \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] 3.8.8 When Does a Limit Exist? For a limit to exist at a point, the function’s behavior must be predictable and consistent as we approach that point. We say: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L \\] only if all three of the following conditions are true: The Left-Hand Limit Exists \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from values less than \\(a\\), the function values must approach a real number. The Right-Hand Limit Exists \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from values greater than \\(a\\), the function values must also approach a real number. The Left- and Right-Hand Limits Are Equal \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] If the two one-sided limits are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist. 3.8.9 When a Limit Does Not Exist A limit fails to exist if any of the following happen: Type of Breakdown What Happens Jump discontinuity Left and right limits are different Infinite discontinuity One or both sides approach \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\) Oscillating behavior Function fluctuates wildly near the point (e.g., \\(\\sin(1/x)\\)) 3.8.10 Environmental Example: Stream Temperature at a Dam Outlet Suppose a river’s temperature is modeled as a piecewise function: \\[ T(x) = \\begin{cases} 15, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\quad \\text{(upstream)} \\\\\\\\ 10, &amp; x &gt; 0 \\quad \\text{(downstream near a cold water dam release)} \\end{cases} \\] At \\(x = 0\\), the left-hand and right-hand limits do not match, so: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} T(x) \\quad \\text{does not exist} \\] This kind of jump is common in natural or engineered boundaries and reminds us that limits describe approaching behavior, not necessarily the value at a point. 3.8.11 Plot the Discontinuity 3.9 From Average to Instantaneous: The Role of Limits In environmental science, we often need to understand how fast something is changing right now — not just on average. Whether it’s the rate at which a glacier melts or how quickly CO₂ levels rise, we need a precise way to describe instantaneous change. But how do we go from a change over time (average) to a momentary change (instantaneous)? 3.9.1 Recap: Average Rate of Change We define the average rate of change of a function \\(f(t)\\) between two times \\(t=a\\) and \\(t=b\\) as: \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] This tells us how much the function changes over the interval — for example, how much sea level rose on average over a 10-year window. To find the function values in the numerator, we would subsitute \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the original function \\(f(t)\\). The denominator is just the difference in time between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), or the interval we are calculating this average. Another form of this equation (which will be useful in a few sections) is achieved by doing a substitution. If we let \\(h\\) be the interval of interest. Then \\(h=b-a\\) The average equation now becomes: \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h} \\] We can go a little further and rearrange the expression for \\(h\\) in terms of \\(b\\) \\[ h=b-a \\\\ b=a+h \\] Substituting this expression for \\(b\\) into the average equaiton gives us \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] So lets think about this in words. The numerator is the difference in the function value at \\(a\\) and some value at \\(a+h\\). The denominator now just becomes the interval over which we are taking the average. We’ll get some practice with this form a little later. 3.9.2 Instantaneous Rate of Change But what if we want to know the rate of change at a single moment, like exactly at year 2020? We can’t plug \\(h = 0\\) directly into the formula — we’d be dividing by zero. Instead, we take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ f&#39;(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(t)}{h} \\] This is the limit definition of a derivative — and it gives us the instantaneous rate of change \\(f&#39;\\) at time \\(a\\). 3.9.3 Environmental Interpretation Let’s say we have a function \\(S(t)\\) that gives sea level (in mm) at year \\(t\\). The instantaneous rate of sea level rise at \\(t = 2020\\) is: \\[ S&#39;(2020) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{S(2020 + h) - S(2020)}{h} \\] This tells us how quickly sea level is rising at that exact year, in mm/year. 3.9.4 Visualizing the Transition Activity: From Average Change to Instantaneous Change Goal: Connect the graph of lake level changes with the equations for average rate of change (secant slope) and instantaneous rate of change (derivative). Step 1: Observe the Graphs (2 minutes) Look at the three panels: Left: secant line from 2005 to 2015 Middle: secant line from 2005 to 2010 Right: secant line from 2005 to 2006 Questions: How does the red secant line change as the interval gets smaller? How does it compare to the green tangent line? Step 2: Recall the Equations (3 minutes) Average rate of change (secant): \\[ \\frac{f(a+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Instantaneous rate of change (derivative): \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Step 3: Explain in Your Own Words (5 minutes) With a partner, explain: What does the average rate of change represent for the lake level between 2005 and 2015? Between 2005 and 2006? How does shrinking the interval \\(h\\) change the meaning of the secant line? Why does the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\) give us the tangent line? Step 4: Environmental Meaning (5 minutes) In the context of lake levels: What does the tangent slope at 2005 represent in words? Why might scientists care about the instantaneous rate instead of just average changes over long intervals? Step 5: Reflection (2 minutes) Complete the sentence in your notes: As \\(h\\) gets smaller, the secant slope \\(\\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}\\) gets closer to the tangent slope. In my own words, this means… 3.10 Finding the Derivative Using the Limit Definition of a Derivative In this section we will use the limit definition of a derivative to find a function that represents the derivative. Let’s consider the following function: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] Note the function here is a function in \\(x\\) Now let’s consider the function at some point on the function where \\(x=a\\). We can re-write the limit definition of a derivative as: \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Let’s now interpret what the math is telling us: \\(f&#39;(a)\\) is the derivative of the function \\(f\\) at \\(x=a\\) \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0}\\) tells us we are going to approach \\(x=a\\) but not quite get there \\(f(a+h)\\) is the function evaluation at \\(x=a+h\\) \\(f(a)\\) is the function evaluated at \\(x=a\\) Now considering these definitions, we can see that if \\(h\\) was greater than zero, this expression would be the average of the function between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=a+h\\). However, the limit operator allows h to approach zero. If were to simply plug \\(h=0\\) into the above expression we would get \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\frac{f(a + 0) - f(a)}{0} = \\frac{0}{0} \\] If you divide anything by zero, your calculator will give you an undefined error. This is why we use the limit, it gets us really really close to zero without actually getting there. Let’s consider the derivative of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and try to find the derivative at \\(x=2\\). We are in search of the derative at \\(x=2\\), this is the same as the slope of the tangent line at same point. The graph above has sketched in the tangent line. We can graphically calculate the slope of the line by looking at the rise over the run. From \\(x=1\\) to \\(x=2\\) we have a run of 1 and a rise of 4. Therefore the slope would be \\(\\frac{4}{1}=4\\). This is the derivative of this function at \\(x=2\\). We don’t always have the ability to solve derivatives graphically, so now that we know the answer we are looking for lets see if we can use the limit definition to get to the same place. \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Let’s practice letting the mathematical expression tell us what to do. We know we are interested at the point \\(x=2\\) so therefore \\(a=2\\). Substituting \\(a=2\\) into the limit definition of a derivative gives us: \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(2 + h) - f(2)}{h} \\] Let’s now look at the numerator the right hand side. It tells us we are looking for the difference between the function evaulated at \\(f(2+h)\\) and \\(f(2)\\). So lets find those expressions. We were given the function as \\(f(x)=x^2\\). So to find \\(f(2+h)\\) and \\(f(2)\\) we subsitute the \\(x\\) in the original function with the points we are interested in. \\(f(2)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(2)= (2)^2=4 \\] \\(f(2+h)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(2+h)= (2+h)^2\\\\ f(2+h)= (2+h)(2+h) = h^2+4h+4 \\] Its best to expand the result so that we can manipulate the function a little easier down the road. We don’t want to substitute anything in for \\(h\\) just yet, we’ll be using the limit operator to deal with the \\(h\\) in a few steps. So now lets combine these two results to get an expression for the numerator: \\[ f(2+h)-f(2)\\\\ (h^2+4h+4)-(4)\\\\ h^2+4h \\] Lets put this back into our limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(2 + h) - f(2)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h} \\] We could now try to see what happens if we push \\(h\\) to its limit \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(0)^2+4(0)}{0}=\\frac{0}{0} \\] This is undefined, and didn’t solve our original issue of dividing by zero. But if we look at the last expression we created, we can see that \\(h\\) could be factored out of the numerator. This would then allow the \\(h\\) in the denominator to be cancelled out. \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(h+4)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+4)\\\\ \\] Now if we take the limit as \\(h\\) approaches zero, think of if as a extremely small number. Then we would have \\(4\\) plus a very very small number. Which is effectively \\(4\\). \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+4)=0+4=4 \\] We have now found the derivative of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) at \\(x=2\\). Or in other words the instantaneous rate of change at that point. 3.10.1 What if we wanted to find the derivative at any point? If the function is smooth and continuous (more on what this means later). Then rather than solving the definition of a function in terms of \\(a\\) we can solve it with respect to any \\(x\\). \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Let’s redo the example but this time instead of \\(a=2\\) let \\(a=x\\). Let’s now look at the numerator the right hand side. It tells us we are looking for the difference between the function evaluated at \\(f(x+h)\\) and \\(f(x)\\). So lets find those expressions. We were given the function as \\(f(x)=x^2\\). So to find \\(f(x+h)\\) and \\(f(x)\\) we subsitute the \\(x\\) in the original function with the points we are interested in. \\(f(x)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(x)= (x)^2=x^2 \\] \\(f(x+h)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(x+h)= (x+h)^2\\\\ f(x+h)= (x+h)(x+h) = x^2+2xh+h^2 \\] Again, we don’t want to substitute anything in for \\(h\\) just yet. So now lets combine these two results to get an expression for the numerator: \\[ f(x+h)-f(x)\\\\ (x^2+2xh+h^2)-(x^2)\\\\ h^2+2xh \\] Lets put this back into our limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+2xh}{h} \\] Once again we can see that \\(h\\) could be factored out of the numerator. This would then allow the \\(h\\) in the denominator to be cancelled out. \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+2xh}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(h+2x)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+2x)\\\\ \\] Now if we take the limit as \\(h\\) approaches zero: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+2x)=0+2x=2x\\\\ f&#39;(x)=2x \\] We have now found the derivative function of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) for all \\(x\\). Or in other words the instantaneous rate of change at any point. Note we can see if we look at \\(x=2\\), the derivative becomes 4 - which was what we got when we looked at the derivative at a point. Lets check it graphically. Using the above function, we could find the derivative of \\(f(x)=x^2\\) at \\(x=1\\). \\[ f&#39;(x)=2x\\\\ f&#39;(1)=2(1)=2 \\] Looking at the graph of the tangent at \\(x=1\\) we can calculate the slope. Using rise over run be can see that the tangent goes from \\((1,1)\\) to \\((3,5)\\), this is a rise of \\(4\\) over a run of \\(2\\). Rise over run gives us a slope of \\(2\\). 3.10.2 When Does a Derivative Exist? (Differentiability Conditions) Before we use derivatives, we need to know when they exist. In other words, under what conditions is a function differentiable at a point? 3.10.2.1 Requirements for Differentiability At a point \\(x = a\\), a function \\(f\\) is differentiable if its instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) exists and is finite. Formally: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] exists and is a real number. For that limit to exist, three conditions must hold: Requirement Meaning What Can Go Wrong 1. Function is defined \\(f(a)\\) exists Hole, asymptote 2. Function is continuous \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\) Jump or removable discontinuity 3. Slope changes smoothly The left- and right-hand difference quotients approach the same finite value Corner, cusp, vertical tangent, oscillation Put simply: A function is differentiable if it is defined, continuous, and smooth (no sharp turns or infinite slopes). 3.10.2.2 Three Conditions for Continuity at a Point A function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at a point \\(x = a\\) if all three of the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The function is defined at \\(a\\) \\[ f(a) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Check that there’s a real number assigned to \\(f(a)\\); the point is not a hole, asymptote, or gap. 2. The limit exists as \\(x \\to a\\) \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Approach \\(a\\) from both the left and right. If the left-hand and right-hand limits agree and are finite, the limit exists. 3. The limit equals the function value \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → In practice: Compare the numerical (or graphical) limit you found with the actual value of \\(f(a)\\). If they match, the function is continuous at that point. Summary: A function is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if: 1. \\(f(a)\\) exists, 2. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)\\) exists, and 3. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\). 3.10.2.3 Smoothness: When Is a Function “Nice Enough” to Differentiate? Continuity alone is not enough for differentiability. A function can be continuous but still have sharp corners, cusps, or vertical tangents where the slope suddenly changes or becomes infinite. To take a derivative, the function must also be smooth — meaning its slope changes gradually. What “Smoothness” Means A function \\(f(x)\\) is smooth at a point \\(x = a\\) if: It is continuous at \\(a\\). Its derivative exists and is finite at \\(a\\). The slope changes continuously (no sudden jumps or sharp turns). In other words, a smooth function has no corners, cusps, breaks, or infinite slopes near that point. How to Test for Smoothness To check whether a function is smooth at \\(x = a\\): Confirm continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → The graph is unbroken at \\(a\\). Check the slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If both limits exist, are finite, and equal each other, the function is smooth at that point. Look for visual cues: A corner or cusp means slopes differ → not smooth. A vertical tangent means infinite slope → not smooth. A continuous curve with gentle slope change → smooth. Why Smoothness Matters Smoothness tells us that the system changes gradually, without abrupt shifts. In environmental modeling, this matters because: Temperature, population, or nutrient levels that change smoothly can be modeled with differential equations. Processes with jumps or discontinuities (like dam releases or landslides) require piecewise or non-differentiable models. Examples Function Smooth? Why \\(f(x) = x^2\\) ✅ Yes Continuous and derivative exists everywhere \\(f(x) = |x|\\) ❌ No Corner at \\(x=0\\) — left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) ❌ No Vertical tangent at \\(x=0\\) (infinite slope) \\(f(x) = x\\sin(1/x)\\) (define \\(f(0)=0\\)) ❌ No Oscillating slope near \\(x=0\\) \\(f(x) = e^{-x^2}\\) ✅ Yes Infinitely smooth everywhere Summary: &gt; A function must be continuous and smooth (no corners, cusps, or infinite slopes) for its derivative to exist at a point. 3.10.2.4 How to Test for Differentiability To test whether \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x=a\\): Check definition: Make sure \\(f(a)\\) exists. → If not, derivative automatically fails. Check continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → If there’s a jump or hole, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) cannot exist. Compare slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If they’re equal and finite, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) exists. → If they differ or blow up, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) does not exist. Key relationship: If \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). However, the converse is not always true — \\(\\text{continuous} \\not\\Rightarrow \\text{differentiable}.\\) 3.10.2.5 Common Ways Differentiability Fails Type of Failure Description Example Discontinuity Jump or hole at the point Step in dam outlet temperature Corner or cusp Left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = |x|\\) at \\(x=0\\) Vertical tangent Slope tends to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) \\(f(x) = (x)^{1/3}\\) at \\(x=0\\) Oscillating slope No single limiting slope \\(f(x) = x \\sin(1/x)\\) at \\(x=0\\) 3.10.2.6 One-Sided and Endpoint Differentiability At the endpoints of a domain (e.g., \\(t \\ge 0\\)), only one side of the function exists. In this case, we use a one-sided derivative: \\[ f&#39;_+(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] The derivative exists at the endpoint if this one-sided limit exists and is finite. 3.10.2.7 Environmental Examples Scenario What’s Happening Differentiability Outcome Dam outlet temperature step Sudden jump between upstream and downstream water Derivative does not exist (discontinuous) Piecewise linear rating curve Continuous but with a sharp corner Derivative does not exist at the corner Sharp flood peak Slope becomes extremely steep Derivative may tend to \\(\\infty\\), so does not exist Smooth glacier retreat curve Continuous and smooth change in slope Differentiable 3.11 Practice: Conceptual Warm-Up These questions will help you review and reinforce key ideas before we dive into graphs and calculations.

Reflect Describe a situation in your field (e.g., climate, marine, ecological, or urban systems) where understanding how fast something is changing could be important. What would the derivative tell you, and how might that help in decision making? 3.12 Practice: Interpreting Derivatives from Graphs In this section, you’ll strengthen your visual intuition about what derivatives represent. We’ll explore how to read increasing/decreasing behavior, slope, and curvature from graphs—and what those features tell us about the underlying system. 1.Identify Slope Behavior from a Graph Below is a sketch of a function representing streamflow over time. Without doing any calculations, answer the following: During which intervals is the function increasing? During which intervals is it decreasing? Find the steepest positive tangent slope and negative tangent slope. Interpret what is physically happening at these moments. Where does the slope of the tangent line appear to be zero? Interpret what is physically happening at these moments. 2.Estimate the Sign of the Derivative For each marked point on the graph below, estimate whether the derivative is: Positive Negative Zero Briefly explain why you came to your conclusion Complete the table: Point Behavior of Function Estimated Sign of Derivative A B C D 3.Sketch the Tangent Line Sketch 3 tangent lines at a point: Where the function is increasing slowly Where the function is increasing rapidly Where the function reaches a minimum Then, graphically estimate the slope of those tangent lines. What do the tangent line slopes mean with respect to the function? 4.Connect Shape to Slope Match the shape of the function to the behavior of its derivative: Function Behavior What Happens to the Derivative? Increasing A. Derivative is positive Decreasing B. Derivative is negative Flat / turning point C. Derivative is zero Steepening D. Derivative is increasing Flattening E. Derivative is decreasing 5.Match the Graph to Its Derivative Which statement is true: The function A is the first derivative of function B The function B is the first derivative of function A An function aren’t related Justify your answer based on slope, curvature, or rate of change 6.Real-World Interpretation \\(H(t)\\) is a graph representing the height (H in meters) of a tidal zone throughout a 24-hour period (t in hours). Based on the graph: When is the tide rising most rapidly? When is the tide falling? Identify all the points where the rate of change of tide height is zero, H’(t) = 0. What do these features represent? 7.Increasing or Decreasing? Consider a graph representing forest biomass over time. Over the 50 years, identify periods of positive, zero and negative slope. In your own words, describe the rate of change through the 50 years Initially: Around yr 25: Towards the end: Identify where the biomass function is concave up and concave down. Try and identify the ‘point of inflection’ - this is the point where the concavity changes from up to down (or down to up). In your own words, describe what these concavity means in relation to the derivative. If the graph started to curve downward: What might that tell us about derivative. 8. Slope Sketch Challenge Sketch a curve that satisfies all of the following: Starts off increasing at \\(x=0\\) Reaches a peak at \\(x =3\\) and then decreases after that Has a steepest decrease aorund \\(x=4\\) and then decreases at a slower rate Label one point where the derivative is positive, one where it is zero, and one where it is negative. 9.Which Graph Matches the Story? Read the scenario below and choose which of the following graphs (A, B, or C) best fits the story. A new invasive plant begins to spread. At first, growth is slow. Then it accelerates rapidly, and finally levels off as it reaches the edges of the available habitat. Graph A: Linear growth Graph B: S-curve (logistic growth) Graph C: Sharp increase followed by sudden drop Why did you choose your answer? What does the slope (derivative) of your choice look like over time? Sketch the derivative of the function you selected 3.13 Practice: Average Rate of Change In this section, you’ll explore the idea of the average rate of change a way of measuring how much a quantity changes per unit of time (or other input) over a chosen interval. Mathematically, it’s the slope of a secant line connecting two points on a graph. You’ll practice working with the formula, sketching diagrams, and interpreting units. You’ll also apply the concept in different contexts. Along the way, you’ll compare positive, negative, and zero rates of change, and connect these slopes to meaningful environmental stories. By the end, you should be able to move confidently between the equation, the graph, and the real-world context to explain what an average rate of change tells us—and what it doesn’t. 1.Concept Check: Formula Write the formula for the average rate of change of a function \\(f(x)\\) from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = b\\). Sketch a diagram, with a random function, and label the following: On the x-axis label \\(x=a, x=b\\) On the y-axis label \\(f(a), f(b)\\) On the function, mark the points at \\((a,f(a)) , (b,f(b))\\) Sketch the secant line Now explain in your own words what each part of the average rate of change formula means. 2.Units Matter If \\(f(t)\\) represents lake temperature in degrees Celsius and \\(t\\) is measured in months, what are the units of the average rate of change? Why are units important when interpreting your result? 3.From a Table of Data The table below shows the carbon content of soil over time. Year Carbon (kg/m²) 2000 4.1 2005 4.8 2010 5.0 Compute the average rate of change from: 2000 to 2005 2005 to 2010 2000 to 2010 Write a statement interpret your result in context, including units. What conclusions can you make? Note: Given the data is in periods of 5 years, no conclusions of what is happening at timescales below 5 years is possible. 4.Graph Interpretation The graph below shows the area of a glacier over time. Choose two points on the graph, estimate their coordinates, and calculate the average rate of change. How can you visually determine if the glacier is shrinking at a constant, accelerating or decelerating rate? 5.Secant Line Visualization The graph below shows the glacier function with a secant line drawn between \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 15\\). Estimate the slope of the secant line and interpret what it means in the context of glacier loss (with units). 6.Environmental Model Application Suppose sea level in a coastal region is modeled by: \\[ S(t) = 3.2t + 45 \\] where \\(S(t)\\) is in millimeters and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Compute the average rate of change of \\(S(t)\\) from 2010 to 2020. State the units of your answer. Interpret the result in the context of sea level trends. 7.Positive vs. Negative vs. Zero Consider the average rate of change of an environmental quantity of your choice over a specified interval. Give one example where the average rate of change would be positive (increasing). Give one example where it would be negative (decreasing). Give one example where it would be approximately zero (stable). For each example, write 1–2 sentences explaining the context and why the sign makes sense. 8.Comparing Intervals Let \\(f(t) = 100 + 2t - 0.1t^2\\) represent the area covered by an invasive weed in (km\\(^2\\)) and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Compute the average rate of change of \\(f\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 5\\). Compute the average rate of change of \\(f\\) from \\(t = 15\\) to \\(t = 20\\). Compare the magnitudes of the two rates. Compare the signs of the two rates Explain what this comparison suggests about how the invasive weed’s rate changes over time. Bonus: Just by looking at the three terms in \\(f(t)\\), can you explain what is happening. Hint: ask your self what happens to each of the terms when t = 0, t is small, t is big 9.Storytelling with Data You are monitoring algae growth in a pond. Between week 2 and week 6, the average rate of change in biomass is \\(0.5 \\,\\text{g}/\\text{m}^2/\\text{week}\\). Rewrite this statement in plain language for a non-technical audience. Briefly describe what additional information (e.g., baseline levels, thresholds, seasonality) would help interpret whether this rate is concerning. Suggest one management action that might follow from this information. 10.Reverse Engineering A study reports that the average rate of change of nitrogen concentration in a stream was \\(-0.2 \\,\\text{mg}/\\text{L}/\\text{year}\\) from 2010 to 2020. Explain the meaning of the negative sign in this context. Provide one plausible environmental reason for this trend List one potential confounding factor that could make this average misleading. State one follow-up analysis you would perform to confirm the trend. 3.14 Practice: Instantaneous Rate of Change In this section, you’ll focus on the instantaneous rate of change, how fast something is changing at one specific moment in time. Unlike the average rate, which looks at overall change across an interval, the instantaneous rate captures the “right now” slope of a tangent line. You’ll practice distinguishing average vs. instantaneous change, sketching tangent lines on curves, and estimating slopes from tables, graphs, and formulas. You’ll also connect these ideas to environmental contexts.By the end, you’ll be able to interpret tangent slopes mathematically and ecologically, explain when instantaneous rates matter more than averages, and use them to make predictions about how environmental systems evolve in real time. 1.Concept Check: Instantaneous vs. Average In your own words, explain the difference between average rate of change and instantaneous rate of change. This time use the equations to help explain yourself - a sketch might even help. Give an environmental example where the two would be very different. 2.Tangent Line Meaning The slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph represents the instantaneous rate of change. Draw a sketch of a random curve and label your axis with some environmental quantity. Pick a point on your sketch and draw a tangent line. Describe in words what the slope means in the context of an environmental scenario you created. 3.Zooming In on a Graph Below is a plot of stream temperature over time. Approximate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 4\\) by drawing a tangent line. Estimate the slope of that tangent line. State what your result means about the rate of temperature change at that moment. 4.Matching Slopes to Graphs Five curves are shown below. Each red point has a different slope. Match each graph to the correct slope value from the list: \\(-1.0\\), \\(4.0\\), \\(-4.0\\), \\(0.5\\), \\(-0.4\\). Explain your reasoning for each match. 5.Instantaneous Rate from a Formula Given: \\[ f(t) = 50 - 4t + 0.2t^2 \\] where \\(t\\) is in years and \\(f(t)\\) is the depth of a wetland pool (cm). In this problem, do not try to calculate the instananous rate of change, but rather lets estimate it from the definition of the derivative: \\[ f&#39;(t) =\\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} \\] Use a small value of \\(h\\), \\(h = 0.1\\), to estimate \\(f&#39;(5)\\). The limit definition equation becomes \\[ f&#39;(t) \\approx \\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} \\] Interpret the result in context, including units. Try again using \\(h = 0.001\\), what do you notice about your estimate? Is it approaching a value? 6.Biological Growth Example A fish population is modeled by: \\[ P(t) = 500 \\cdot e^{0.08t} \\] where \\(t\\) is in months and \\(P(t)\\) is the number of individuals. Estimate \\(P&#39;(6)\\) using the limit definition of a derivative. Interpret the meaning of your answer in terms of fish population growth. 7.Zero Instantaneous Rate Give one real-world environmental example where the instantaneous rate of change would be exactly zero at some point in time. Sketch a graph of this situation. Explain why the slope is zero at that point. 8.Comparing Instantaneous Rates Below is a plot of soil moisture over time after a rainstorm. Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 5\\) by drawing tangent lines. Compare the magnitudes of the two slopes. Explain what this says about how quickly the soil is drying over time. 9.From Instantaneous to Prediction The temperature in a tide pool is changing at a rate given by: \\[ \\frac{dT}{dt} = -0.3 \\quad \\text{(deg C per hour)} \\] at \\(t = 5\\) hours after sunrise, and the temperature at that time is 22.5 deg C. Use this instantaneous rate to predict the temperature one hour later, assuming the rate stays constant. Explain whether this is likely to be an overestimate or underestimate in a real tide pool system, and why. 3.15 Practice: Limit Definition of a Derivative In this section, you’ll practice the core mathematical manipulations needed to compute derivatives directly from their limit definition. While shortcut rules for differentiation are faster, the limit definition is the foundation that makes those rules possible. Working through examples at specific points, for general functions, and with small numerical approximations will strengthen your algebra skills and deepen your understanding of where derivatives come from. You’ll also explore cases where limits fail (corners, jumps), and apply the definition to real data and environmental contexts. By the end, you should feel comfortable setting up and simplifying the difference quotient, interpreting results with correct units, and explaining why limits are essential to the concept of instantaneous change. 1.Basic Derivative at a Point Use the limit definition of the derivative to compute \\(f&#39;(3)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] 2.General Derivative from Limit Definition Using the limit definition, find the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = 5x - 7 \\] 3.Cubic Function at a Point Compute \\(f&#39;(2)\\) using the limit definition for: \\[ f(x) = x^3 \\] 4.Estimate with Small \\(h\\) Sometimes it’s easier to estimate a derivative numerically when the exact limit is messy. Use: \\[ f&#39;(a) \\approx \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] with \\(h = 0.001\\) to estimate \\(f&#39;(4)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\] Explain why this approximation works for smooth functions. 5.Environmental Example: Tree Height Growth Let \\(H(t) = 2.5\\sqrt{t}\\) represent the height (m) of a young tree after \\(t\\) years. Use \\(h = 0.0001\\) to estimate \\(H&#39;(1)\\). Estimate \\(H&#39;(5)\\) Interpret your answer in words, what is happening to the growth rate? 6.When the Limit Fails to Exist: Corner Consider: \\[ f(x) = |x - 2| \\] Use the limit definition of a derivative from the left and right at \\(x = 2\\). Explain why \\(f&#39;(2)\\) does not exist. 7.When the Limit Fails to Exist: Jump Let: \\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 3x + 1, &amp; x &lt; 1 \\\\ x^2, &amp; x \\geq 1 \\end{cases} \\] Use the limit definition of the derivative from each side at \\(x = 1\\). Explain why the derivative fails to exist at that point. 8.Estimate from Real Data The dissolved oxygen (DO) in a lake was measured over several days: Day DO (mg/L) 4.9 8.15 5.0 8.10 5.1 8.05 Use \\(h = 0.1\\) and the limit definition of a derivative to estimate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 5.0\\). Include units in your answer. 9.Derivative of a Quadratic For: \\[ f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 \\] 1. Derive \\(f&#39;(x)\\) using the limit definition. 2. Now examine you answer, what happened to the \\(3x^2\\) term? What about the \\(4x\\) term? What about the \\(5\\)? 10.Challenge: Fractional Function Using the limit definition, find \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] State the domain for which the derivative exists. Explain why \\(x = 0\\) must be excluded. 3.16 Practice: Environmental “Explain and Explore” Prompts Having practiced the mechanics of the limit definition, you now have the tools to calculate derivatives from first principles. In the next section, we’ll step back from the algebra and focus on the bigger picture: how rates of change help us interpret environmental systems and real-world data. In this section, you’ll shift from practicing the mechanics of the limit definition to exploring how derivatives help us understand real environmental systems. The goal here is not to calculate every derivative by hand, but to think about what the rate of change means in context—whether it’s the growth of a fish population, the retreat of a glacier, or the decline of dissolved oxygen in a lake. You’ll connect mathematical concepts like slopes and instantaneous change to real-world data, scenarios, and management questions. By the end, you should be able to explain in your own words how derivatives provide insight into environmental patterns and processes, and why they are a powerful tool for interpreting change. 1.Marine Biology Describe a marine ecosystem where tracking a population. What rates would be of interest? What kind of data would you need to compute it? 2.Forestry Think of a forest growth or health measure. How would knowing the derivative help inform forest management decisions? What tools or data sets could you use to estimate it? 3.Climate Science Choose a climate-related variable. What insight would the derivative give about changes in this variable? How might the time scale of measurement (daily vs. yearly) affect your interpretation? 4.Freshwater Ecology Identify a lake, river, or wetland variable that changes in response to seasonal cycles. Describe a situation where you would want to know its rate of change. What measurement frequency would be needed to detect rapid changes? 5.Human–Environment Interaction Pick a human activity that influences an environmental variable. How would you use the derivative to monitor and evaluate the impact? What kinds of monitoring programs or data sets could provide the necessary data?

Thankfully, mathematicians have developed rules that make the process faster, more intuitive, and easier to apply to real-world problems. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use these rules to quickly find derivatives of functions you’re likely to encounter in environmental science—whether you’re modeling the growth of a forest, the spread of an invasive species, or the rate at which pollutants enter a river. We’ll focus on developing your comfort with: Recognizing patterns in how functions are built Reading mathematical expressions like a set of instructions Applying derivative rules like shortcuts to understand change more efficiently By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to: Use basic derivative rules to handle powers, constants, sums, and exponential functions Apply the product, quotient, and chain rule to more complex functions Interpret what each rule tells you about how and why a system is changing Remember: Derivatives aren’t just algebra tricks—they’re windows into the behavior of systems over time. 4.1 Reading Mathematical Expressions Like a Set of Instructions Many students struggle with math not because they don’t understand the underlying concepts, but because they see mathematical expressions as mysterious symbols on a page rather than what they truly are: a sequence of instructions. Each symbol and operator is like a verb telling you what to do next. For example, the “+” sign isn’t just a mark—it literally means “add these numbers together.” A derivative symbol, rather than being abstract, is simply an instruction to “find how fast this quantity is changing.” When you begin to think of math as a set of steps or commands, it becomes less about memorization and more about following a recipe or a set of directions. This shift in perspective can transform math from something intimidating into something procedural and logical, where each step flows naturally from the last. Just as reading a musical score tells a musician which notes to play and when, reading a mathematical expression tells us which operations to perform and in what order. 4.1.1 Think of Math as a Recipe Just like a recipe tells you what to do and in what order, a mathematical expression tells you how to process the input (usually a variable like \\(x\\)) to get an output. Let’s take a simple example: \\[ f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2 \\] This is not just a formula—it’s a set of steps: Take the input \\(x\\) Square it: \\(x^2\\) Multiply by 3: \\(3x^2\\) Multiply the original \\(x\\) by 5: \\(5x\\) Subtract: \\(3x^2 - 5x\\) Add 2 You don’t need to memorize the formula—you just need to follow the steps. 4.1.2 Operators Are Instructions The symbols you see are operators: They tell you what to do with each piece of the function. Symbol Instruction \\(+\\) Add two quantities \\(-\\) Subtract one quantity from another \\(\\times\\) Multiply \\(\\div\\) or fraction bar Divide \\(^\\) Raise to a power \\(\\sqrt{\\cdot}\\) Take the square root Each operator builds on the last. When reading from left to right, use parentheses to help clarify what happens first. 4.1.3 Why This Matters for Derivatives To take a derivative, you must examine how a function is constructed. That’s because: Each term contributes to the overall rate of change Derivative rules apply to specific structures (e.g. products, chains, powers) The better you can “read” an expression, the easier it becomes to: Pick the right rule Avoid mistakes Explain what the math means in context Activity: Reading the Math — What Is the Function Telling You? In environmental science, mathematical models describe how systems change over time. To understand those models, we need to learn how to read equations like a story. Let’s consider a function that models fish population \\(P(t)\\) (in thousands) over time \\(t\\) (in years): \\[ P(t) = 100e^{0.05t} - 20t \\] This expression might describe fish population growth that is limited by fishing, pollution, or resource depletion. Questions to Guide Your Thinking Try to interpret each part of this function like a set of instructions. Answer the questions below to help unpack the meaning of the expression. Overall Structure How many terms are in this function? What is being added or subtracted? First Term: \\(100e^{0.05t}\\) What kind of growth does this term represent? What is the role of the 100? What does the exponent \\(0.05t\\) suggest about the growth rate? Second Term: \\(-20t\\) What kind of relationship is this? Why might the model include a linear decrease? What could be happening in the environment to cause a consistent population loss over time? Big Picture What do you think happens to the population as time goes on? Is there a time when the population might start declining instead of growing? What real-world processes could this equation be modeling? Write Your Own Interpretation In your own words, describe what each part of the function is doing. Try completing this sentence: “The term \\(100e^{0.05t}\\) tells me that the population is…, while the term \\(-20t\\) tells me that…” 4.1.4 Why This Matters Being able to read a function is just as important as being able to solve it. By understanding how the structure reflects environmental processes, you’ll be better prepared to: Apply the correct derivative rules Interpret changes in real systems Communicate what the math means to others 4.1.5 Environmental Example Suppose the temperature of a lake over time is modeled by: \\[ T(t) = 18 + 2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) \\] And we are also given the derivative function: \\[ T&#39;(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) \\] Then: \\(T(t)\\) tells the relationship between temperature an time \\(T&#39;(t)\\) tells you the rate of change in temperature at any moment. \\(\\frac{dT}{dt}\\) is the same thing, just written in a form that highlights that we’re differentiating temperature with respect to time. Reading the math: Try to explain in words what T(t) looks like, break the equation up and tell the story of temperature of this lake. Now try and tell the story of the derivative function. When is the temperature the highest? What is the rate of change at this point? Does this make sense? When is the rate of temperature change the highest? What is the temperature at this point? Does this make sense? 4.1.6 Reflect and Connect Graphical relationship between functions and their derivatives Examine the plots below. Can you explain the relationship between the two lines? What do they tell us about the function? Where is the derivative equal to zero? What feature do you see on the function at these points? The function changes concavity at some point, what do you see in the derivative at this point? Activity: Reading and Writing Derivatives Understanding notation is like learning to read a map: it helps you navigate and communicate mathematical ideas clearly. With practice, it becomes second nature! Understanding derivative notation helps you interpret, communicate, and solve real-world problems. In this activity, you’ll practice converting between different forms and interpreting real-world scenarios. Step 1: Interpreting a Scenario Scenario: The population \\(P\\) of a coastal bird species is changing over time. A biologist says: “The rate of change in population is proportional to the square of the time since a conservation effort began.” Questions: Define the input and output variables in this problem. What does “rate of change in population” suggest mathematically? Write a formula that expresses this relationship using derivative notation. Hint: If \\(y\\) was proportional to \\(x\\) it would mean the \\(y = k.x\\) where \\(k\\) is some constant \\(k\\). Discussion Prompts Why might a conservationist want to know the rate at which a population is changing, not just its size? By the end of this activity, you should feel more confident identifying, interpreting, and converting derivative notation—skills that will help throughout this chapter. 4.2 Introduction to Basic Derivative Rules Now that you understand what a derivative is and how it connects to rates of change, we can start building your toolkit for taking derivatives quickly and confidently. The following table summarizes the most commonly used basic derivative rules. These rules allow us to differentiate many types of functions without going back to the limit definition each time. Keep this table handy—it’s your go-to reference for tackling many of the problems you’ll encounter in calculus and environmental modeling. Rule Formula Example Constant Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(c) = 0\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(7) = 0\\) Power Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^n) = n x^{n - 1}\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2\\) Constant Multiple \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[c \\cdot f(x)] = c f&#39;(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(5x^4) = 20x^3\\) Sum Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + g(x)] = f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + 3x) = 2x + 3\\) Difference Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) - g(x)] = f&#39;(x) - g&#39;(x)\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - 4x^2) = 3x^2 - 8x\\) Exponential Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(3e^x) = 3e^x\\) Logarithmic Rule \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln(2x)) = \\frac{1}{x}\\) Trig: Sine \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sin x) = \\cos x\\) — Trig: Cosine \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\cos x) = -\\sin x\\) — 4.2.1 The Constant Rule The Constant Rule tells us how to take the derivative of a constant. A constant doesn’t change, so its rate of change is zero. This makes sense because the derivative measures how quickly a function’s output changes as the input changes. If the function is always the same number, then no matter what value of \\(x\\) you plug in, the result doesn’t move—it’s perfectly flat. Rule: If \\[ f(x) = c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant (like 3, 5, or 100), then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] You can visualize this by graphing a constant function, such as \\(f(x) = 4\\). The graph is a horizontal line. Since the slope of a horizontal line is zero everywhere, the derivative is also zero everywhere. 4.2.2 Environmental Interpretation This rule may seem simple, but it matters in real-world modeling. For example, suppose you measure the background level of a pollutant in a lake that remains steady over time (say, \\(2\\) parts per million). Because this concentration is constant, its rate of change with respect to time is zero. Similarly, a flat baseline temperature in a climate dataset or a fixed conservation quota can be represented as a constant function whose derivative is always zero. The Constant Rule reminds us that when nothing changes, the mathematics reflects that stillness directly: no change means no slope, and thus a derivative of zero.Graphically, we can see this by the fact than a tangent line anywhere on teh funtion would be ‘flat’ with a slope of zero. The Constant Rule tells us how to take the derivative of a constant. A constant doesn’t change, so its rate of change is zero. Rule: If \\[ f(x) = c \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant (like 3, 5, or 100), then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.1 Environmental Example Imagine you’re measuring the temperature in a perfectly climate-controlled greenhouse. If the temperature stays at 25°C all day, the rate of temperature change at any point is zero—it’s constant. So the derivative is: \\[ \\frac{d}{dt}(25) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.2 Example 2 Let \\[ f(x) = 7 \\] Then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.3 Example 3 Let \\[ T(t) = 12 \\] \\(T(t)\\) represents a temperature function that never changes. The rate of change of temperature over time is: \\[ T&#39;(t) = 0 \\] 4.2.2.4 Takeaway If a function doesn’t change—like a flat line on a graph—its slope and rate of change are both zero. So anytime you’re taking the derivative of a constant value, the result is always: \\[ \\boxed{0} \\] 4.2.3 The Power Rule The Power Rule is one of the most important and widely used rules in calculus. It tells us how to differentiate expressions involving powers of \\(x\\). Because so many functions in environmental science (and beyond) can be expressed as polynomials, this rule becomes one of the most frequently applied tools in your calculus toolkit. Rule: If \\[ f(x) = x^n \\] where \\(n\\) is any real number, then \\[ f&#39;(x) = n x^{n - 1} \\] The idea is straightforward: bring the exponent down in front as a multiplier, and then reduce the exponent by one. This simple pattern makes it easy to quickly compute derivatives of terms like \\(x^2\\), \\(x^3\\), or even fractional and negative powers such as \\(x^{1/2}\\) or \\(x^{-3}\\). Examples: \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2) = 2x\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^5) = 5x^4\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(x^{-2}) = -2x^{-3}\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2}\\) Why it matters: Most polynomials, which are just sums of power functions (like \\(3x^4 - 2x^2 + 7\\)), can be differentiated term by term using the Power Rule. This makes them some of the easiest functions to work with in calculus. Environmental interpretation: The Power Rule shows up when modeling physical quantities that scale with area or volume. For example: The cross-sectional area of a circular tree trunk is proportional to \\(r^2\\). If the radius of the trunk is changing over time, the rate of change of area can be found using the Power Rule. The volume of a sphere (like a balloon or water droplet) depends on \\(r^3\\). Differentiating with respect to time gives the rate at which volume changes as the radius grows or shrinks. In allometric scaling (relationships between body size and metabolism), power functions often describe how one ecological trait depends on another, and their rates of change can be quickly found using this rule. By mastering the Power Rule, you gain a quick way to move from expressions of size or shape to expressions of change—a central theme in applying calculus to environmental science. 4.2.4 Polynomials and Their Derivatives Here’s how different powers of \\(x\\) behave and how their derivatives affect the shape of their graphs: Power (n) Function \\(f(x) = x^n\\) Graph Type Derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\) Graph of Derivative 0 \\(x^0 = 1\\) Constant \\(0\\) Flat line at 0 1 \\(x^1 = x\\) Linear (straight line) \\(1\\) Flat line at 1 2 \\(x^2\\) Quadratic (parabola) \\(2x\\) Linear 3 \\(x^3\\) Cubic curve \\(3x^2\\) Parabola 4 \\(x^4\\) Quartic (W-shape) \\(4x^3\\) Cubic curve Note: The derivative of a polynomial is always another polynomial of one degree lower. 4.2.5 Environmental Interpretation Suppose you’re modeling tree growth height over time using a power function: \\[ H(t) = t^2 \\] The rate of growth at any time \\(t\\) is: \\[ H&#39;(t) = 2t \\] This means the tree grows faster as time increases—something we often observe in early growth stages of many plants. 4.2.6 Example 1 Let \\[ f(x) = x^5 \\] It helps to identify the different parts of the function. So in this function \\(n=5\\). So we could now replace 5 into the power rule derivative expression Then \\[ f&#39;(x) = n x^{n - 1} \\\\ f&#39;(x) = (5) x^{5-1} \\\\ f&#39;(x) = 5x^4 \\] 4.2.7 Example 2 Let \\[ V(t) = t^3 \\] Where V(t) represents the volume of glacial melt water over time. To find the rate of melt is we would use the power law with \\(n=3\\) \\[ V&#39;(t) = nt^{n-1} \\\\ V&#39;(t) = n(3)t^{3-1} \\\\ V&#39;(t) = 3t^2 \\] 4.2.8 Takeaway Any time you see a variable raised to a power, apply the power rule: Multiply by the original exponent Subtract 1 from the exponent This rule works for whole numbers, fractions, and even negative exponents! Derivatives of fractional powers Find the derivative of \\[ y = \\sqrt {x} \\] Hint: can you write \\(\\sqrt {x}\\) as a power? 4.2.9 The Constant Multiple Rule The Constant Multiple Rule tells us that when a function is multiplied by a constant, we can find the derivative by simply multiplying the derivative of the function by that constant. This rule may feel obvious once you see it, but it’s surprisingly powerful. It tells us that constants don’t change the shape of the function’s derivative—they only scale it up or down. The slope patterns all stay the same, just stretched or compressed vertically. 4.2.9.1 Constant Multiple Rule (Function Notation) If \\[ f(x) = c \\cdot g(x) \\] where \\(c\\) is a constant, then \\[ f&#39;(x) = c \\cdot g&#39;(x) \\] 4.2.9.2 Constant Multiple Rule (Leibniz / Operator Notation) We can also write this using the derivative operator \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\): \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ c \\cdot g(x) \\right] = c \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ g(x) \\right] \\] This shows that the operator \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) “passes through” the constant—it only acts on the function part \\(g(x)\\), not on the constant. This works because constants don’t change as \\(x\\) changes, so they don’t contribute to the rate of change. Instead, they simply scale the rate of change of the underlying function. 4.2.10 Environmental Interpretation The Constant Multiple Rule is especially important in environmental modeling, where constants often represent scaling factors such as efficiency, conversion rates, or unit adjustments. These constants don’t alter how a system changes, only the magnitude of that change. Suppose the CO₂ uptake by a certain plant species is modeled by: \\[ U(t) = 0.3t^2 \\] Here we can map the function to the rule: \\(c = 0.3\\) (a constant that might represent efficiency or an uptake rate coefficient) \\(g(t) = t^2\\) (the underlying growth process in time) Applying the Constant Multiple Rule: \\[ U&#39;(t) = c \\cdot g&#39;(t) = (0.3)(2t) = 0.6t \\] This result tells us that the CO₂ uptake rate increases linearly with time. The coefficient \\(0.6\\) is simply the constant scaling the underlying process. 4.2.11 Example 1 Let \\[ f(x) = 7x^3 \\] Here, \\(c = 7\\) and \\(g(x) = x^3\\). Differentiate \\(g(x)\\) using the Power Rule: \\[ g&#39;(x) = 3x^2 \\] Now apply the Constant Multiple Rule: \\[ f&#39;(x) = c \\cdot g&#39;(x) = 7 \\cdot (3x^2) = 21x^2 \\] 4.2.12 Key Idea The constant just comes along for the ride. Differentiate the function as usual, then multiply the result by the constant. Tip: This rule is especially helpful when dealing with models where scaling factors are built into the equation. 4.2.13 The Sum and Difference Rules The Sum and Difference Rules tell us that the derivative of a sum or difference is simply the sum or difference of the derivatives. In other words, differentiation distributes over addition and subtraction. This is powerful because it means we can take a complicated expression, break it into smaller, more manageable parts, and then handle each piece on its own before recombining the results. For example, suppose we want to differentiate \\[ f(x) = 3x^2 + \\sin(x) - e^x. \\] Instead of treating the entire function as a single, tangled object, we can separate it into three parts: \\(3x^2\\), \\(\\sin(x)\\), and \\(-e^x\\). We find the derivative of each term individually (\\(6x\\), \\(\\cos(x)\\), and \\(-e^x\\), respectively) and then add them back together. The process mirrors how scientists often analyze complex environmental systems—by breaking them into components that are easier to study before piecing them back together into a whole. In environmental contexts, this rule shows up naturally. Imagine a model of a river’s flow rate that combines multiple factors: snowmelt, rainfall, and groundwater inputs. Each of these factors may follow its own mathematical relationship with time. By using the Sum Rule, we can calculate the overall rate of change in river flow by adding the individual rates of change of snowmelt, rainfall, and groundwater. This makes the mathematics not only simpler but also more meaningful, because it aligns with how we understand real-world systems as combinations of interacting parts. 4.2.13.1 Rule (Function Notation) If \\[ f(x) = g(x) \\pm h(x) \\] then \\[ f&#39;(x) = g&#39;(x) \\pm h&#39;(x) \\] 4.2.13.2 Rule (Leibniz / Operator Notation) Using operator notation: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ g(x) \\pm h(x) \\right] = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ g(x) \\right] \\pm \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ h(x) \\right] \\] The derivative distributes over addition and subtraction. This works because differentiation is a linear operation. 4.2.14 Environmental Interpretation Suppose a wetland ecosystem has total carbon uptake modeled as the sum of uptake from two plant species: \\[ U_1(t) = (0.2t^2 + 0.5t) \\\\ U_2(t) = (t^3) \\\\ U_T= U_1(t)+U_2(t)=0.2t^2 + 0.5t +t^3 \\] It makes sense then that the total uptake, \\(U_T\\), would be the uptake from both the species added together. The rate of total uptake is: \\[ U_T&#39;(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(0.2t^2 + 0.5t +t^3) \\] Using the sum derivative rule we could re-write the about expression as the sum of three derivatives: \\[ U_T&#39;(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(0.2t^2) + \\frac{d}{dt}(0.5t) + \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3) \\] One it is in this form we apply the rules we let he math tell us what to do. The above expression is saying “the rate of uptake is the sum of three derivatives”. Remember \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) is an operatator telling us to ‘take the derivative of’ what ever comes next. [ \\[\\begin{aligned} \\text{1st Term:} \\quad &amp; \\frac{d}{dt}(0.2t^2) = 0.2 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}(t^2) = 0.2 \\cdot (2t) = 0.4t \\\\[6pt] \\text{2nd Term:} \\quad &amp; \\frac{d}{dt}(0.5t) = 0.5 \\cdot \\frac{d}{dt}(t) = 0.5 \\cdot (1) = 0.5 \\\\[6pt] \\text{3rd Term:} \\quad &amp; \\frac{d}{dt}(t^3) = 3t^2 \\\\[10pt] \\end{aligned}\\] ] So the derivative is: \\[ U&#39;_T(t) = 0.4t + 0.5 + 3t^2. \\] We applied the derivative to each term, then combined the results. For the first and second term we used the constant multiplier rule and power rules. For the third term all we needed was the power rule. 4.2.15 Example 1 Let \\[ f(x) = x^3 + 5x - 4 \\] Then \\[ f&#39;(x) = 3x^2 + 5 \\] (The derivative of a constant like \\(-4\\) is 0.) 4.2.16 Example 2 Let \\[ P(t) = 6t^2 - 4t + 9 \\] Then \\[ P&#39;(t) = 12t - 4 \\] 4.2.17 Key Idea Break the function into pieces using + and – signs. Apply known derivative rules to each term, then combine them. Tip: Combine the Constant Multiple Rule with the Sum and Difference Rules to quickly differentiate polynomials and real-world models. 4.2.18 The Exponential Rule One of the most remarkable functions in all of calculus is the natural exponential function (e): \\[ f(x) = e^x \\] This function is unique because its rate of change is equal to its value at every point: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} (e^x) = e^x \\] This means that the tangent line at any point on the graph has a slope equal to the height of the curve at that point. No other elementary function has this “self-replicating” property. If the function’s value is small, its slope is small. If the function’s value is large, its slope is large. Growth and steepness always keep pace with each other. This is why \\(e^x\\) is so central in calculus: it perfectly embodies the idea of proportional change. 4.2.19 Environmental Interpretation Exponential functions appear frequently in environmental science because many natural processes change at a rate proportional to their current size or amount. This “proportional change” is what gives rise to exponential growth or decay. Some common examples include: Population growth in ideal conditions When resources are abundant and limiting factors are minimal, populations can grow exponentially. For example, bacteria in a nutrient-rich environment may double at a fixed time interval. While no population can grow exponentially forever, this model is useful for understanding the early phases of population expansion or for comparing how fast different species can reproduce. Radioactive decay Radioactive isotopes, such as carbon-14, decay at a rate proportional to the remaining quantity. This predictable exponential decay makes them powerful tools for dating environmental samples, such as using radiocarbon dating to estimate the age of fossils, soils, or archaeological artifacts. Spread of invasive species or diseases Invasive plants or pathogens can initially spread exponentially when introduced into a new habitat, before natural controls (predators, competition, or resource limits) slow their growth. Atmospheric processes Exponential decay is also used to model how pollutants or greenhouse gases diminish in the atmosphere over time through processes like chemical breakdown or absorption. These examples highlight why exponential functions are so central to environmental science: they provide a first-order approximation of how systems evolve when the rate of change depends directly on the current state. Later, more complex models (e.g., logistic growth or coupled differential equations) can capture limits and interactions, but exponential functions form the foundation. 4.2.20 Key Insight The exponential function grows faster and faster, but always in proportion to how large it already is. This self-replicating property makes it powerful—and dangerous—in real-world systems. Discussion Prompt Can you think of natural exponential processes that are of concern&gt; 4.2.21 Examples \\(\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x\\) \\(\\frac{d}{dx} 5e^x = 5e^x\\) ⟶ constant multiple rule still applies \\(\\frac{d}{dx} e^{2x} = 2e^{2x}\\) ⟶ chain rule! (covered next) 4.2.22 Summary The derivative of \\(e^x\\) is itself. Exponential models describe growth at a rate proportional to value. This rule forms the backbone of many environmental models involving runaway feedback, like CO₂ buildup or species invasion. 4.2.23 The Natural Logarithm Rule The natural logarithm function \\(\\ln(x)\\) is the inverse of the exponential function \\(e^x\\). While the exponential function grows at a rate proportional to its current size, the logarithm grows more and more slowly as \\(x\\) increases. This slowing growth makes the logarithm especially useful in environmental models where diminishing returns or slowing growth are observed—for example, nutrient absorption in plants, the effect of adding fertilizer to soil, or population responses as they approach a carrying capacity. 4.2.23.1 Inverse Functions An inverse function basically undoes what the original function does. If a function takes you from input → output, the inverse takes you from that output → back to the input. Think of it like this: Multiplying by 2 and then dividing by 2 get you back where you started. Exponentials and logarithms work the same way—\\(e^x\\) and \\(\\ln(x)\\) undo each other. So, an inverse function is just a mathematical “reverse button.” 4.2.24 Key Insight The logarithm is only defined for positive values of \\(x\\). Its rate of change is steep when \\(x\\) is close to zero, but gradually flattens out as \\(x\\) gets larger. The derivative captures this behavior: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] This formula tells us that as \\(x\\) grows, the slope decreases. For very large \\(x\\), the slope approaches zero—indicating almost no change. 4.2.25 Examples Basic Rule \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] At \\(x=1\\), the slope is \\(1\\). At \\(x=10\\), the slope is only \\(0.1\\). Log of a scaled input \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(3x) = \\frac{1}{3x} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{1}{x} \\] Notice that the factor of 3 cancels out in this case, showing that \\(\\ln(3x)\\) grows at the same rate as \\(\\ln(x)\\). Log of a power \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x^2) = \\frac{1}{x^2} \\cdot 2x = \\frac{2}{x} \\] This highlights how the chain rule applies inside logarithms: the derivative of the “inside” function modifies the result. 4.2.26 Environmental Interpretation The logarithmic rule is useful for modeling processes where growth slows over time or with increasing input: Resource depletion: As resources (like groundwater or fisheries) are consumed, the additional gain from each new unit of effort declines. Nutrient absorption: Plants absorb nutrients quickly when soil is depleted, but the uptake rate slows as the soil becomes saturated. Population growth toward carrying capacity: While early growth may look exponential, the long-term response often involves slowing growth that logarithms help describe. In each case, the logarithm captures the idea that the “marginal returns” diminish as the system grows larger. 4.2.27 Summary The derivative of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is \\(\\tfrac{1}{x}\\). The slope decreases as \\(x\\) increases, showing diminishing change. This makes logarithmic models ideal for studying slowing growth, saturation effects, and resource limits in environmental systems. 4.3 Product, Quotient, and Chain Rule So far, we’ve explored basic derivative rules for individual terms—constants, powers, exponentials, and logarithms. But what happens when functions are combined? In real-world environmental systems, variables are rarely isolated. Instead, they interact: A pollution level might depend on population size × emission rate A species population might grow based on a changing habitat and food supply A rate of nutrient absorption might be modeled by a composite function like \\(\\ln(e^{kt})\\) In these situations, we need a new set of rules to differentiate combined functions: The Product Rule: for multiplying two functions The Quotient Rule: for dividing two functions The Chain Rule: for nested (composite) functions These rules help us break down complex expressions into manageable parts, and they are essential for modeling dynamic, interconnected systems in environmental science. 4.3.1 Summary Table: Rules for Combined Functions Rule Expression Derivative Product Rule \\(f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) \\cdot g(x) + f(x) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) Quotient Rule \\(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\) \\(\\frac{f&#39;(x) \\cdot g(x) - f(x) \\cdot g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2}\\) Chain Rule \\(f(g(x))\\) \\(f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) We’ll walk through each of these rules with examples and visuals that connect directly to environmental applications. 4.3.2 Real-World Applications of Product, Quotient, and Chain Rules 4.3.2.1 Product Rule: Two Changing Quantities Multiplied Scenario: Modeling carbon emissions from a city. Let: - \\(P(t)\\) = population size (increasing over time) - \\(E(t)\\) = emissions per person Then total emissions is: \\[ C(t) = P(t) \\cdot E(t) \\] To find how fast emissions are growing, we use the product rule: \\[ C&#39;(t) = P&#39;(t) \\cdot E(t) + P(t) \\cdot E&#39;(t) \\] This lets us understand whether total emissions are rising due to more people, more emissions per person, or both. 4.3.2.2 Quotient Rule: One Changing Quantity Divided by Another Scenario: Modeling pollution concentration in a lake. Let: - \\(A(t)\\) = total pollutant amount (changing due to runoff or decay) - \\(V(t)\\) = lake volume (changing due to rainfall or evaporation) Pollution concentration is: \\[ C(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V(t)} \\] To find how the concentration is changing, we use the quotient rule: \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{A&#39;(t)V(t) - A(t)V&#39;(t)}{[V(t)]^2} \\] This shows that increasing volume (dilution) can decrease concentration, even if pollutant levels stay the same. 4.3.2.3 Chain Rule: One Function Inside Another Scenario: Modeling temperature-dependent species growth. Let: \\(T(t)\\) = temperature over time (changes daily or seasonally) \\(G(T)\\) = growth rate as a function of temperature Then species growth rate over time is: \\[ G(t) = G(T(t)) \\] To find the rate of change of growth over time: \\[ G&#39;(t) = G&#39;(T) \\cdot T&#39;(t) \\] This lets us account for how growth indirectly changes with time due to temperature variation. These examples show how derivative rules help us uncover the drivers of change in complex, real-world systems. 4.4 The Product Rule In calculus, the Product Rule is used to take the derivative of a product of two functions. If a quantity depends on two changing functions multiplied together, we can’t simply take the derivative of each part independently. We need a rule that accounts for how both parts change together. The rule is written as: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\big[f(x)\\,g(x)\\big] \\;=\\; f(x)\\,g&#39;(x) \\;+\\; f&#39;(x)\\,g(x). \\] You may also see this written using \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) notation: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}(uv) \\;=\\; u\\,\\frac{dv}{dx} \\;+\\; \\frac{du}{dx}\\,v \\quad\\text{or}\\quad \\frac{d}{dx}(uv) \\;=\\; u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v. \\] Here, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are stand-ins for the two functions being multiplied. They’re just labels to organize your work. 4.4.1 Why Does the Rule Work? (Intuition) Think of a rectangle whose sides change with \\(x\\): width \\(= f(x)\\), height \\(= g(x)\\). The area is \\(A(x) = f(x)\\,g(x)\\). When \\(x\\) increases a tiny amount, both sides change a tiny bit. The area increases due to: 1) the width changing while the height is held (momentarily) fixed, plus 2) the height changing while the width is held (momentarily) fixed. Those two contributions add up: \\[ \\Delta A \\approx f(x)\\,\\Delta g \\;+\\; g(x)\\,\\Delta f \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad A&#39;(x) = f(x)g&#39;(x) + f&#39;(x)g(x). \\] Mnemonic: “first × (derivative of second) + (derivative of first) × second.” Only one part gets differentiated in each term. Quick Activity: Visualizing the Product Rule with Area Imagine a square whose side length depends on \\(x\\). At some moment, its sides have length \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). The area is: \\[ A(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x) \\] Now suppose \\(x\\) increases by a tiny amount. Both sides of the square grow a little bit, which means new thin strips of area get added around the edges. Instructions: 1. Draw a rectangle on your paper. Label the horizontal side \\(f(x)\\) and the vertical side \\(g(x)\\). 2. Increase both sides slightly: imagine the new side lengths are \\(f(x) + \\Delta f\\) and \\(g(x) + \\Delta g\\). 3. Shade in the new area that gets added: A horizontal strip of area: \\(f(x)\\cdot \\Delta g\\) A vertical strip of area: \\(g(x)\\cdot \\Delta f\\) (Ignore the tiny corner piece \\(\\Delta f \\cdot \\Delta g\\)—it’s very small compared to the strips.) Identify each piece: which strip corresponds to \\(f(x)\\,g&#39;(x)\\), and which to \\(f&#39;(x)\\,g(x)\\)? Connect back: notice that the total new area is just the sum of those strips, which is exactly the Product Rule. Discussion Prompt Why do we get two separate terms instead of one? What would happen if we only counted one strip? 4.4.2 Step-by-Step Example (using \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) notation) Differentiate \\(f(x) = (2x^2)(\\ln x)\\). Label parts clearly Let’s break the product into two pieces: \\(u = 2x^2\\) (a polynomial) \\(v = \\ln x\\) (a logarithm) Tip: Identifying \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) first prevents mistakes later when plugging into the Product Rule. It’s like naming the players before describing the play. Differentiate each part \\(u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2) = 4x\\) \\(v&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln x) = \\tfrac{1}{x}\\) Notice how the rules we’ve already learned come together here: the Power Rule for \\(2x^2\\), and the Logarithm Rule for \\(\\ln x\\). Apply the Product Rule Recall: \\((uv)&#39; = u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\). Substitute in each part: \\[ f&#39;(x) = u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v = (2x^2)\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) + (4x)(\\ln x). \\] The first term represents the change when \\(\\ln x\\) changes while \\(2x^2\\) stays fixed. The second term represents the change when \\(2x^2\\) changes while \\(\\ln x\\) stays fixed. Together, they capture the total change. Simplify the expression \\[ f&#39;(x) = 2x + 4x\\ln x. \\] Always check if terms can be simplified. Here, \\(\\tfrac{2x^2}{x} = 2x\\). A simpler final answer makes patterns easier to see and avoids unnecessary complexity. What we learned here: The Product Rule ensures both changing parts of the product are accounted for. Each derivative rule (Power, Logarithm, Constant Multiple) can appear inside a Product Rule problem. Simplification at the end often reveals a cleaner structure—in this case, notice how both terms share a factor of \\(x\\): \\[ f&#39;(x) = x(2 + 4\\ln x). \\] Factoring can make the expression easier to interpret, especially if you’ll use it later in optimization or modeling. 4.4.3 Step-by-Step Example (using \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) notation) Differentiate \\[ h(x) = (x^3)(e^x). \\] Identify each function Let \\(f(x) = x^3\\) Let \\(g(x) = e^x\\) Then \\(h(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x)\\). Differentiate each part \\(f&#39;(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^3) = 3x^2\\) \\(g&#39;(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(e^x) = e^x\\) Notice how we’re reusing familiar rules: the Power Rule and the Exponential Rule. Apply the Product Rule Recall: \\[ (fg)&#39; = f \\cdot g&#39; + f&#39; \\cdot g \\] Substitute \\(f(x), f&#39;(x), g(x), g&#39;(x)\\): \\[ h&#39;(x) = f(x)g&#39;(x) + f&#39;(x)g(x) \\] \\[ h&#39;(x) = (x^3)(e^x) + (3x^2)(e^x). \\] Simplify the expression Factor out the common term \\(e^x\\): \\[ h&#39;(x) = e^x(x^3 + 3x^2). \\] Factoring here makes the structure more visible: the exponential \\(e^x\\) “comes along for the ride,” while the polynomial part handles the changing powers of \\(x\\). Takeaway: When using \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) notation, the Product Rule formula is straightforward: Multiply the original \\(f\\) by the derivative of \\(g\\), Add the derivative of \\(f\\) times the original \\(g\\). 4.4.4 Environmental Example Suppose total forest biomass \\(B(t)\\) is the product of: - Tree density \\(D(t) = 50e^{0.02t}\\) (number of trees per hectare, growing approximately exponentially), - Average tree mass \\(M(t) = 100 + 5\\sin t\\) (average mass of an individual tree, fluctuating slightly with seasonal cycles). Then the total biomass is: \\[ B(t) = D(t)\\,M(t). \\] 4.4.4.1 Step-by-Step Differentiation Label each part clearly \\(u = 50e^{0.02t}\\) (density of trees, growing steadily) \\(v = 100 + 5\\sin t\\) (mass per tree, oscillating over time) Splitting the model into density and mass mirrors how ecologists break down population and individual traits. Differentiate each part \\(u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dt}(50e^{0.02t}) = 50 \\cdot 0.02e^{0.02t} = e^{0.02t}\\) (density is increasing at a constant 2% growth rate) \\(v&#39; = \\frac{d}{dt}(100 + 5\\sin t) = 5\\cos t\\) (tree mass changes cyclically, speeding up when \\(\\cos t\\) is large) Notice how exponential growth (for density) and oscillatory change (for mass) combine in this model. Apply the Product Rule \\[ B&#39;(t) = u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v \\] Substituting: \\[ B&#39;(t) = 50e^{0.02t}\\cdot 5\\cos t \\;+\\; e^{0.02t}(100 + 5\\sin t). \\] The first term represents biomass change driven by seasonal shifts in mass while density stays fixed. The second term represents biomass change driven by density growth while tree mass stays fixed. Interpretation of the Result First term: \\(50e^{0.02t}\\cdot 5\\cos t\\) captures the effect of seasonal mass fluctuations across all trees. When \\(\\cos t &gt; 0\\), trees are gaining mass on average, boosting biomass. When \\(\\cos t &lt; 0\\), they are losing mass, reducing biomass. Second term: \\(e^{0.02t}(100 + 5\\sin t)\\) captures the effect of increasing density. Even if individual trees aren’t changing much, adding more trees steadily increases total biomass. Together, these terms highlight how two biological processes interact: population expansion and seasonal changes in individual growth. The Product Rule ensures both are accounted for simultaneously. Big Idea: The Product Rule isn’t just an abstract formula—it matches how environmental systems behave. Complex outcomes often come from two simpler factors interacting, and calculus gives us a precise way to measure those interactions. 4.4.5 When to Use (and Not Use) Use Product Rule when the expression is a product of two changing functions (e.g., \\(x^2 e^x\\), \\(\\ln x \\cdot \\sin x\\), \\(D(t)M(t)\\)). Don’t use Product Rule for a constant multiple: \\(7x^3\\) → use the Constant Multiple Rule. If you see a composition (e.g., \\(e^{2x}\\), \\(\\ln(x^2+1)\\)), that’s the Chain Rule (sometimes combined with a Product Rule if there’s also a product). 4.4.6 Common Pitfalls &amp; Quick Checks Wrong pattern: \\((uv)&#39; \\neq u&#39;v&#39;\\) — you must add the two terms \\(u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\). Units check: If \\(u\\) has units A and \\(v\\) has units B, then each term in \\(u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\) has units A·B per unit \\(x.\\) Mismatched units can reveal algebra slips. Symmetry check: Swapping \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) leaves \\(u\\,v&#39; + u&#39;\\,v\\) unchanged—good sanity check. Quick Practice Differentiate \\(f(x) = x^3\\ln x\\). Differentiate \\(g(x) = (1+x^2)\\,e^x\\) and factor the result. Environmental: If river discharge \\(Q(t) = A(t)\\,v(t)\\) with cross-sectional area \\(A\\) and velocity \\(v\\), write \\(Q&#39;(t)\\) and explain each term in words. 4.4.7 Summary The Product Rule handles derivatives of products: \\[ (fg)&#39; = f\\,g&#39; + f&#39;\\,g. \\] Intuition: change from the first factor plus change from the second factor. Differentiate one factor at a time, then add. 4.5 The Quotient Rule In calculus, the Quotient Rule is used to take the derivative of a quotient of two functions. If a quantity depends on one function divided by another, we need a rule that tells us how to account for both the numerator and the denominator changing at the same time. The rule is written as: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right] = \\frac{g(x) \\cdot f&#39;(x) - f(x) \\cdot g&#39;(x)}{[g(x)]^2} \\] You may also see this written using \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) notation: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right) = \\frac{v \\cdot u&#39; - u \\cdot v&#39;}{v^2} \\] Here, \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) are dummy variables—stand-ins for the numerator and denominator functions. They’re useful for understanding the structure of the rule, but in real problems, you’ll work with named expressions like \\(f(x)\\), \\(C(t)\\), or \\(B(t)\\). 4.5.1 Why Does the Rule Work? When dividing two functions, both the top and bottom are changing—and that affects the overall rate of change. The Quotient Rule carefully balances these changes: It starts with the derivative of the top times the bottom Then subtracts the top times the derivative of the bottom And finally divides everything by the square of the bottom function 4.5.2 Step-by-Step Process (Quotient Rule) Differentiate: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 3}{x + 1}. \\] Label each part \\(u = 2x^2 + 3\\) (the numerator) \\(v = x + 1\\) (the denominator) Just like in the Product Rule, we split the expression into two parts, but now we have a fraction. It helps to keep “top = \\(u\\)” and “bottom = \\(v\\)” in mind. Differentiate each part \\(u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(2x^2 + 3) = 4x\\) \\(v&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(x+1) = 1\\) Nothing tricky here: numerator is a polynomial, denominator is linear. Apply the Quotient Rule Recall the formula: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{v\\cdot u&#39; - u\\cdot v&#39;}{v^2}. \\] Substituting our parts: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{(x+1)(4x) - (2x^2+3)(1)}{(x+1)^2}. \\] Notice the subtraction in the numerator. This is what distinguishes the Quotient Rule from the Product Rule. A useful mnemonic: “low d-high minus high d-low, over low-low.” (low = denominator, high = numerator) Simplify the expression Expand and combine terms in the numerator: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{4x^2 + 4x - 2x^2 - 3}{(x+1)^2}. \\] Combine like terms: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{2x^2 + 4x - 3}{(x+1)^2}. \\] Simplifying makes the structure clearer and prepares the result for later use (like plugging into a model or checking limits). 4.5.3 Key Idea The Quotient Rule accounts for the fact that both numerator and denominator are changing. The subtraction ensures we capture the effect of the denominator’s change correctly. Forgetting the subtraction is one of the most common student mistakes. 4.5.4 Example 2: Environmental Application Suppose the nutrient concentration in a lake is modeled by a ratio: Total nutrient mass: \\(N(t) = 100 + 20t\\) Water volume: \\(V(t) = 500 + 10\\cos(t)\\) Then: \\[ C(t) = \\frac{N(t)}{V(t)} = \\frac{100 + 20t}{500 + 10\\cos(t)} \\] Let’s find the rate of change \\(C&#39;(t)\\), step by step. 4.5.4.1 Step-by-Step Process Label each part: Let \\(u = 100 + 20t\\) Let \\(v = 500 + 10\\cos(t)\\) Differentiate each part: \\(u&#39; = 20\\) \\(v&#39; = -10\\sin(t)\\) Apply the quotient rule: \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{v \\cdot u&#39; - u \\cdot v&#39;}{v^2} \\] \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{(500 + 10\\cos(t))(20) - (100 + 20t)(-10\\sin(t))}{(500 + 10\\cos(t))^2} \\] Simplify the expression: \\[ C&#39;(t) = \\frac{10000 + 200\\cos(t) + 1000\\sin(t) + 200t\\sin(t)}{(500 + 10\\cos(t))^2} \\] This expression tells you how quickly the concentration is changing over time—factoring in both the growing nutrient load and seasonal fluctuations in water volume. 4.5.5 Summary The Quotient Rule helps you differentiate when one function is divided by another. Remember: - Differentiate the top and bottom separately - Apply the rule: \\(\\frac{v \\cdot u&#39; - u \\cdot v&#39;}{v^2}\\) - Keep track of signs—subtraction matters! - This rule tells you exactly what to do in a structured, step-by-step way. 4.6 The Chain Rule In calculus, the Chain Rule is used when you’re taking the derivative of a composite function—that is, one function nested inside another. This happens all the time in environmental modeling, where one variable depends on another that itself is changing. The Chain Rule is written as: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ f(g(x)) \\right] = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x) \\] Or in \\(u\\)-notation: \\[ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx} \\] Here, \\(y = f(u)\\) and \\(u = g(x)\\), so you’re taking the derivative of the outer function, evaluated at the inner function, and then multiplying by the derivative of the inner function. 4.6.1 Composite Functions (Plain English) Before you apply the Chain Rule, it’s helpful to get a clear sense of what a composite function is in everyday terms. A composite function is when one function feeds into another. Think of it like a pipeline: the output of the first function becomes the input of the second. Examples in words: “Take a number, square it, then take the sine.” That’s \\(\\sin(x^2)\\). “Take a number, double it, then plug it into an exponential.” That’s \\(e^{2x}\\). So instead of two functions side by side (product) or one divided by another (quotient), a composite is one function wrapped inside another. Plain English rule: When you differentiate a composite, you have to respect the layers. Start with the outside layer, then peel back and multiply by the derivative of the inside layer. It’s like peeling an onion, one layer at a time. 4.6.2 Why Does the Rule Work? Chain Rule Hike Let’s explore the Chain Rule through a real-world analogy. Your trail distance itself depends on how much time you’ve been walking. So the final question is: how fast is your distance from camp changing with time? Step 2: Break down the layers Let’s introduce some symbols: Let \\(C\\) = your distance from camp (in miles). Let \\(s\\) = your distance along the trail (in miles). Let \\(t\\) = time (in hours). Try this: - What is C a function of? Write the expression - What is s a function of? Write the expression - Can you combine these two functions as a composite function? Step 3: Think about the rates separately Ask yourself two smaller questions: How does \\(C\\) change when \\(s\\) changes? How does \\(s\\) change when \\(t\\) changes? Step 4: Combine the rates Now connect them. To find how \\(C\\) changes with respect to \\(t\\): \\[ \\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{dC}{ds} \\cdot \\frac{ds}{dt}. \\] This is the Chain Rule in action: the overall rate is the product of the two linked rates. Step 5: Reflect Why do we multiply instead of add? What would happen if the trail were straight versus winding? How does this analogy help you understand why the Chain Rule is needed when functions are “nested”? The Chain Rule is just formalizing the idea of a “rate of a rate.” If you know how fast one thing changes with another, and how that second thing changes with time, you can multiply the two to find the total rate of change. 4.6.3 Step-by-Step Process (Chain Rule in Action) Differentiate: \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{3x^2 + 1}. \\] Identify inner and outer functions The function has a nesting: The inner function is what’s inside the square root: \\[ u = 3x^2 + 1. \\] The outer function is the square root itself: \\[ f(u) = \\sqrt{u} = u^{1/2}. \\] Tip: Always peel back the layers like an onion. First ask, “What’s wrapped around the \\(x\\)?” Here, the outer layer is the square root, wrapped around \\(3x^2 + 1\\). Differentiate each part Differentiate the outer function with respect to its input \\(u\\): \\[ f&#39;(u) = \\frac{d}{du}(u^{1/2}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}u^{-1/2}. \\] This says: the slope of the square root gets smaller as \\(u\\) gets bigger. Differentiate the inner function with respect to \\(x\\): \\[ u&#39; = \\frac{d}{dx}(3x^2+1) = 6x. \\] The inner part is just a polynomial; its slope grows linearly with \\(x\\). Apply the Chain Rule The Chain Rule says: \\[ \\frac{df}{dx} = f&#39;(u)\\cdot u&#39;. \\] Substitute our results: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\Big(\\tfrac{1}{2}(3x^2+1)^{-1/2}\\Big)\\cdot (6x). \\] Interpretation: take the derivative of the square root as if it were just \\(u\\), then multiply by how fast the inside (\\(3x^2+1\\)) is changing. Simplify the expression Multiply constants: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{6x}{2}(3x^2+1)^{-1/2}. \\] Reduce the fraction: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 3x(3x^2+1)^{-1/2}. \\] Rewrite the negative exponent as a square root: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{3x}{\\sqrt{3x^2+1}}. \\] Takeaway: The Chain Rule is about peeling off the outer layer, differentiating it, and then multiplying by how fast the inner layer changes. Without the inner derivative, the answer will always be incomplete. 4.6.4 Example 2: Environmental Application Suppose the water temperature in a stream increases due to sunlight exposure over time, and the rate of fish metabolism \\(M\\) depends on that temperature: Temperature: \\(T(t) = 10 + 5\\sin(t)\\) (base temperature of 10°C plus daily/seasonal fluctuations of ±5°C modeled by a sine wave) Metabolism: \\(M(T) = e^{0.2T}\\) (exponential relationship between metabolism and temperature, as often seen in biological processes) So the composite function is: \\[ M(t) = e^{0.2(10 + 5\\sin(t))}. \\] We want to differentiate \\(M(t)\\) with respect to time \\(t\\) to see how quickly fish metabolism is changing over time. 4.6.4.1 Step-by-Step Process Label inner and outer functions Inner function: \\[ u = 10 + 5\\sin(t) \\] This is the temperature as a function of time. Outer function: \\[ M(u) = e^{0.2u} \\] This is the metabolism as a function of temperature. Always start by peeling back the layers: first the sine-based temperature change (inner), then the exponential response (outer). Differentiate each part Outer derivative: \\[ \\frac{dM}{du} = 0.2e^{0.2u} \\] This says that metabolism increases at a rate proportional to its current level—classic exponential growth. Inner derivative: \\[ \\frac{du}{dt} = 5\\cos(t) \\] The rate of temperature change depends on the cosine curve: steepest at midpoints of the sine wave (sunrise/sunset) and flat at peaks/troughs (midday/night). Apply the Chain Rule Combine the pieces: \\[ M&#39;(t) = \\frac{dM}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dt} = 0.2e^{0.2(10 + 5\\sin(t))} \\cdot 5\\cos(t). \\] This formula captures two processes at once: the exponential sensitivity of metabolism to temperature and the sinusoidal fluctuation of temperature with time. Simplify the expression Multiply constants: \\[ M&#39;(t) = e^{0.2(10 + 5\\sin(t))} \\cdot \\cos(t).\\\\ M&#39;(t) = e^{2 + \\sin(t)} \\cdot \\cos(t).\\\\ \\] Notice how cleanly the constants combine—the factor of \\(0.2\\) and the \\(5\\) become a neat multiplier of \\(1\\). The result shows metabolism change is driven by both the direction of temperature change (sign of \\(\\cos t\\)) and the magnitude of metabolism (the exponential). 4.6.5 Interpretation When \\(\\cos(t) &gt; 0\\): temperature is rising, so metabolism is increasing. When \\(\\cos(t) &lt; 0\\): temperature is falling, so metabolism is decreasing. When \\(\\cos(t) = 0\\): temperature is at its peak or trough, so metabolism is momentarily changing at rate zero (flat slope). This matches ecological intuition: metabolism accelerates most when temperature is changing quickly, and stabilizes when temperature is near extremes. Takeaway: This example shows why the Chain Rule is essential in environmental modeling, variables rarely depend on time directly. Instead, they depend on other variables (like temperature), which themselves depend on time or other drivers. The Chain Rule is how we connect all the links in the chain. 4.6.6 Summary The Chain Rule is used when one function is inside another—a composite function. Step 1: Identify the outer function and the inner function. Step 2: Differentiate each one. Step 3: Multiply them together: (outer derivative, evaluated at the inner) × (inner derivative). In plain terms: differentiate layer by layer. This happens constantly in real-world systems, where one variable depends on another that is also changing. 4.7 Practice: Basic Derivative Rules 4.7.1 Skill Drills — Build Comfort Through Repetition When you first learned multiplication tables, you didn’t stop after doing one or two — you practiced until you could recall them without thinking. Derivatives work the same way. The goal here isn’t to memorize answers, but to train your brain to recognize patterns and apply the right rule automatically. The faster and more confidently you can work with the basic derivative rules — constant, power, constant multiple, sum/difference, exponentials, logarithms, and simple trigonometric derivatives — the more mental bandwidth you’ll have later for tackling bigger problems involving multiple rules, chain rule, or real-world applications. These problems are your reps in the derivative gym. Work through them steadily, write each step, and check your answers. Over time, your speed and accuracy will improve without you even noticing. Instructions: Differentiate each function using only the basic derivative rules (no product, quotient, or chain rules needed). \\(f(x) = 7\\) \\(g(x) = x^5\\) \\(h(x) = -3x^{-2}\\) \\(p(t) = \\sqrt{t}\\) \\(q(s) = \\dfrac{1}{s^3}\\) \\(r(x) = 4x^7 - 5x + 2\\) \\(m(y) = -\\dfrac{1}{2}y^{4} + 7y^{2}\\) \\(n(z) = 12e^{z}\\) \\(k(x) = e^{-5x}\\) \\(P(t) = \\ln t\\) \\(Q(r) = 5\\ln r - 2r\\) \\(R(\\theta) = \\sin\\theta\\) \\(S(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta\\) \\(T(x) = -\\tan x\\) \\(U(s) = 9s^{1/3} - 4s^{-1/2}\\) \\(V(t) = 6e^{3t} - 10\\) \\(W(x) = 0.1x^{4} + 0.25x^{-3}\\) \\(X(y) = 2\\sin y - 3\\cos y\\) \\(Y(x) = 4e^{x} + \\ln x\\) \\(Z(\\theta) = 5\\theta^{2} - 7\\sin\\theta + e^{\\theta}\\) \\(f(x) = -11\\) \\(g(x) = 15x\\) \\(h(t) = t^{10}\\) \\(p(s) = -4s^{-4}\\) \\(q(y) = \\sqrt[3]{y}\\) \\(r(x) = \\dfrac{7}{x^5}\\) \\(m(z) = z^{1/2} - z^{-1/2}\\) \\(n(t) = 0.5t^{8} - 3t^{3} + 2t\\) \\(k(x) = -\\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-6} + 9x^{2}\\) \\(P(t) = 100e^{t}\\) \\(Q(r) = e^{-0.2r}\\) \\(R(\\theta) = \\ln \\theta\\) \\(S(x) = -6\\ln x + 8x\\) \\(T(t) = \\sin t\\) \\(U(\\theta) = -\\cos\\theta\\) \\(V(x) = 12\\tan x\\) \\(W(s) = s^{3/4} + 4s^{-2/3}\\) \\(X(t) = -0.3t^{5} + 2.5t^{-4}\\) \\(Y(y) = 9e^{7y} - 12\\) \\(Z(x) = e^{-4x} + e^{5x}\\) \\(A(u) = 2\\sin u + 3\\cos u\\) \\(B(\\theta) = -\\sin\\theta - \\cos\\theta\\) \\(C(x) = 7x^{9} + \\tfrac{1}{3}x^{-9}\\) \\(D(t) = -8e^{2t} + 5e^{-t}\\) \\(E(s) = \\ln s - 4e^{s}\\) \\(F(y) = 3y^{0.5} - 4y^{2.5}\\) \\(G(x) = x^{7/3} - 5x^{-7/3}\\) \\(H(z) = 0.01z^{5} + 12z^{-5}\\) \\(J(t) = 2\\sin t - 0.5\\tan t\\) \\(K(x) = e^{x} + \\ln x - x^{4}\\) 4.8 Practice: Product &amp; Quotient Rules Up until now, we’ve only differentiated expressions built from single terms or simple sums. But in real problems, functions are often multiplied or divided — and the basic power, exponential, or trig rules aren’t enough. That’s where the product rule and quotient rule come in: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\big[ f(x)g(x) \\big] = f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x) \\] \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\right] = \\frac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{\\big[g(x)\\big]^2} \\] Tips for success: 1. Identify which rule applies by looking at the top level of the function: product or quotient. 2. Differentiate one part at a time, keeping the other part unchanged. 3. Use parentheses generously — they protect you from sign and order mistakes. Instructions: Differentiate each function. Apply the product or quotient rule as needed. Use other basic rules inside as appropriate. \\(f(x) = (x^3+2)(x^2-5)\\) \\(g(t) = t^4 e^{t}\\) \\(h(x) = \\sin x \\cdot \\ln x\\) \\(p(z) = (3z^{-2} - 5)(z^4 + 1)\\) \\(q(t) = \\dfrac{t^3 + 4}{t^2 - 1}\\) \\(r(x) = \\dfrac{\\ln x}{x^3}\\) \\(s(\\theta) = \\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{e^{\\theta}}\\) \\(u(y) = (y^2+1)(e^{-2y})\\) \\(v(x) = \\dfrac{e^{x} + x}{\\sqrt{x}}\\) \\(w(t) = \\dfrac{\\cos t}{1+t^2}\\) \\(m(x) = (5x^2 - 4x + 1)(x^{-3})\\) \\(n(t) = \\dfrac{t e^{t}}{t^2+1}\\) \\(k(y) = (y^3+2y)\\sin y\\) \\(P(r) = \\dfrac{1 + \\ln r}{r}\\) \\(Q(\\theta) = \\dfrac{\\cos(2\\theta)}{\\theta^4}\\) \\(R(z) = (z^5 - z)\\,e^{-z}\\) \\(S(x) = \\dfrac{x^2+1}{e^{3x}}\\) \\(T(t) = (4t^{-1} + t^2)(\\ln t)\\) \\(U(y) = \\dfrac{\\sin y + y^2}{\\cos y}\\) \\(V(x) = \\dfrac{x e^{x}}{x-5}\\) 4.9 Practice: Chain Rule Practice Sometimes a function isn’t just one clean layer — it’s a function inside another function. That’s when you use the chain rule. It tells us: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} f(g(x)) = f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x) \\] Think of it as peeling an onion: 1. Differentiate the outer function first (leave the inside unchanged). 2. Multiply by the derivative of the inner function. Tips for success: - Always identify the inner and outer function before you start. - Parentheses are your friend — they keep track of what’s “inside.” - Don’t forget the inner derivative — that’s the most common mistake! Instructions: Differentiate each function using the chain rule. Apply other basic rules inside as needed. \\(f(x) = (3x+2)^{5}\\) \\(g(t) = \\sqrt{5t^2 - 4}\\) \\(h(z) = \\ln(4z^3 - z)\\) \\(p(y) = e^{2y - y^2}\\) \\(q(\\theta) = \\sin(7\\theta - 3)\\) \\(r(x) = \\cos(x^4 + 1)\\) \\(s(t) = \\tan(5t)\\) \\(u(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x^2 + 4x - 1}\\) \\(v(z) = e^{\\sin z}\\) \\(w(r) = \\ln\\!\\big(\\sqrt{r^2+9}\\big)\\) 4.10 Practice: Mixed Rules — Putting It All Together So far, you’ve practiced each rule on its own: - Basic rules for powers, exponentials, logs, and trig. - Product and quotient rules for multiplication and division. - Chain rule for nested functions. But real functions — especially in environmental science models — rarely come neatly packaged for a single rule. You might have to use the product rule on the outside and the chain rule inside, or start with the quotient rule and then use a basic rule on each term. This section helps you get comfortable choosing and combining rules. The goal isn’t speed — it’s knowing how to break the problem down into manageable steps.

The difference is in the interpreation of the signs. The second derivative sign chart helps us determine information about the functions convavity. 5.6 Optimizaiton", " Chapter 5  Under Construction: Applications 5.1 Using Derivatives to Find Extremes In environmental science, we often want to know: What is the maximum population an ecosystem can support? When is the lowest point of CO₂ emissions over time? At what point will a species’ growth rate slow down? These kinds of questions are about extrema—finding the highest or lowest values a function can take. Mathematically, these points are called maximums and minimums. Together, we call them extreme values. And calculus gives us a powerful tool to find them: the derivative. 5.2 The Idea If a function reaches a peak or a valley, its graph changes direction. At that turning point, the slope of the tangent line is zero. So, we look for values of \\(x\\) where: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] These are called critical points. They are the candidates for maximums or minimums. 5.3 Step-by-Step: Finding Extrema Here’s the process we’ll use: Take the derivative of the function. Find critical points by solving \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\). Use a first derivative sign chart and second derivative sign chart to classify each critical point as a maximum, minimum, or neither. Evaluate the function at those points to find the extreme values. 5.3.1 Step 1: Take the Derivative To find extrema, our first step is to compute the derivative of the function. This derivative represents the rate of change of the quantity we’re modeling—how fast it’s increasing or decreasing at each point. 5.3.1.1 Why the Derivative? If we think of a graph as a hill or a valley, then: The slope of the function tells us whether we’re going uphill (positive slope) or downhill (negative slope). At a peak or valley, the slope flattens out. That’s why extrema occur when the derivative equals zero. ####️ How to Differentiate To take the derivative, apply the derivative rules you’ve learned—like the power rule, sum rule, product rule, or chain rule—term by term. Tip: Write your function neatly and apply rules one piece at a time. If your function involves products, quotients, or composition of functions, use the appropriate rules (Product Rule, Quotient Rule, Chain Rule). 5.3.1.2 What You’re Looking For You’re not just taking the derivative for fun—you want to use it to find the points where the function might turn around (peaks and valleys). That’s what the next step is all about: solving \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) to find those critical points. 5.3.2 Step 2: Find the Critical Points Now that we have the derivative, the next step is to find the values of \\(x\\) where the slope is zero. These are called critical points—the points where the function might reach a maximum or minimum. 5.3.2.1 Why Set the Derivative to Zero? At any peak or valley on a graph, the function levels off, meaning the slope is zero. So, to find these potential extrema, we solve: \\[ f&#39;(x) = 0 \\] Critical points also occur where the derivative is undefined—like at sharp corners or cusps—but for now we’re focusing on smooth curves where the derivative exists everywhere. Depending on the complexity of the derivative, you might: Try factoring the expression (easiest when possible) Use the quadratic formula if the derivative is quadratic Use numerical methods or a graphing tool if algebraic solutions are tricky 5.3.2.2 Strategy Tips Always try factoring first. It’s often the fastest way to identify roots. If factoring fails and your equation is quadratic, use the quadratic formula: \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\] If your equation is higher-degree and doesn’t factor easily, consider graphing the derivative or using numerical solvers in R, a calculator, or software like Desmos. Once you’ve found the critical points, you can analyze each one to determine whether it’s a maximum, minimum, or neither. 5.3.3 Step 3: Classify Each Critical Point Using a Sign Chart After finding the critical points (where \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\)), we need to determine whether each one corresponds to a local maximum, local minimum, or neither. One powerful tool for this is the first derivative sign chart. This method helps us understand how the function behaves around each critical point by analyzing whether the slope is positive or negative on either side. 5.3.3.1 How to Build a First Derivative Sign Chart Factor the derivative, if possible. This makes it easier to identify where the sign changes occur. Mark the critical points on a number line. These divide the domain into intervals. Choose a test value in each interval. Plug the test value into the factored derivative to determine its sign in that interval. Record the sign of the derivative in each interval. If the sign changes from positive to negative, the function has a local maximum. If the sign changes from negative to positive, the function has a local minimum. If the sign does not change, it may be a flat point or inflection point. 5.3.3.2 What the Signs Tell You Interval Sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\) Behavior of \\(f(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) Positive Function is increasing \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) Negative Function is decreasing \\(f&#39;(x) = 0\\) Zero at a point Function has flat slope By sketching this number line and labeling the behavior in each interval, we can visualize how the function is changing and pinpoint maxima and minima accurately. Tip: Always include the sign of the leading coefficient in your analysis! It can flip the sign of the entire derivative. 5.3.4 Step 4: Evaluate the Function at the Critical Points Once you’ve identified which critical points are maximums or minimums, the next step is to find the actual function values at those points. These values represent the extrema—the highest and lowest outputs of the function. 5.3.4.1 How to Evaluate To do this, simply substitute each critical point back into the original function (not the derivative). If your function is \\(f(x)\\), and your critical points are \\(x = a\\) and \\(x = b\\), you compute: \\(f(a)\\): the function value at the first critical point \\(f(b)\\): the function value at the second critical point Repeat this for all critical points. 5.3.4.2 What You’ve Learned The value \\(f(a)\\) tells you how high or low the function gets at \\(x = a\\) Comparing all the values lets you determine which are local minimums, local maximums, or global extremes 5.3.4.3 Final Step Once you’ve evaluated the function at each critical point, you can summarize the extrema as coordinate points: Minimum: \\((a, f(a))\\) Maximum: \\((b, f(b))\\) These coordinates give precise information about where and when a quantity reaches its highest or lowest point—critical in environmental models, economics, biology, and more. 5.4  Environmental Example: A Cubic Population Model Let’s investigate a population model defined by a cubic function: \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2 - 9t + 20 \\] # Define the cubic function P &lt;- function(t) -t^3 + 6*t^2 - 9*t + 20 # Plot the function curve(P(x), from = 0, to = 5, xlab = &quot;Time (t)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Population P(t)&quot;, main = expression(P(t) == -t^3 + 6*t^2 - 9*t + 20), col = &quot;forestgreen&quot;, lwd = 2) # Add grid grid() This function could represent a population that declines initially and reaches a minimum. Due to favorable conditions the population starts to increase, and then declines because of environmental stressors like competition, disease, or habitat loss. 5.4.1 Step 1: Find the First Derivative To identify when the population reaches a local maximum or minimum, we begin by finding the first derivative of the function \\(P(t)\\). The first derivative tells us the rate of change of the population with respect to time — in other words, whether the population is increasing or decreasing at a given moment. Our original function is: \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2 - 9t + 20 \\] To take the derivative, apply the power rule term by term: The derivative of \\(-t^3\\) is \\(-3t^2\\) The derivative of \\(6t^2\\) is \\(12t\\) The derivative of \\(-9t\\) is \\(-9\\) The constant term \\(20\\) has a derivative of 0 (since constants don’t change) So the full derivative is: \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3t^2 + 12t - 9 \\] 5.4.2 What Does This Mean? This new function \\(P&#39;(t)\\) describes how fast the population is changing at any given time \\(t\\). If \\(P&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\), the population is increasing. If \\(P&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\), the population is decreasing. If \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\), the population has a horizontal slope — which might indicate a peak (maximum) or valley (minimum). Next Step: To find the exact moments when these changes occur, we set \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\) and solve for \\(t\\). This gives us the critical points where the population may reach an extreme value. 5.4.3 Step 2: Find the Critical Points To find extreme points (like maximums or minimums), we look for where the derivative equals zero. These are called critical points, and they occur where: The slope of the function is zero (i.e., a horizontal tangent line), or The derivative is undefined (we’ll cover this a little later). We’re solving: \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3t^2 + 12t - 9 = 0 \\] This is a quadratic equation, so we can solve it by factoring or using the quadratic formula. 5.4.3.1 Try Factoring First We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \\(-3\\): \\[ t^2 - 4t + 3 = 0 \\] Now factor: \\[ (t - 1)(t - 3) = 0 \\] This tells us the derivative is zero at: \\[ t = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = 3 \\] These are our critical points — the places where the slope of the curve is zero, and the function might reach a local max or min. 5.4.3.2 When Factoring Doesn’t Work Sometimes factoring is difficult or impossible. If our derivative is a quadratic equation, we use the quadratic formula: \\[ t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\] For our derivative: \\[ P&#39;(t) = at^2 + bt + c = -3t^2 + 12t - 9 \\] So: \\(a = -3\\) \\(b = 12\\) \\(c = -9\\) Plugging into the formula: \\[ t = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{(12)^2 - 4(-3)(-9)}}{2(-3)} = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 108}}{-6} \\] \\[ t = \\frac{-12 \\pm \\sqrt{36}}{-6} = \\frac{-12 \\pm 6}{-6} \\] \\[ t = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad t = 3 \\] Key Takeaway: Whether you factor or use the quadratic formula, the goal is the same: Find where the derivative equals zero. These points are where the original function might reach a peak or valley. 5.4.4 Step 3: Constructing a Sign Chart Let’s dig deeper into how to analyze the sign of a derivative in different intervals using the factored form. When we think of a local maximum - we think of this as a high point on the function, so either side of the function would decrease from this peak. So as we approach a maxima, the slope of the function would be positive. At the maxima (the critical point), the slope goes to zero. Then as we come down of the peak, the slope of function is negative. The reverse is true for a mimima. This feature is what a sign chart takes advantage of. What we will be doing is looking at the sign of the derivative on either side of a critical point. And bsed on the the sign determine if its a max or a min. In this example we’re working with the first derivative: \\[ P&#39;(t) = -3(t - 1)(t - 3) \\] This is already factored, which makes it easier to analyze. So the critical points are at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 3\\). Sketch a number line and place these critical points on the line library(ggplot2) ggplot() + # Number line with arrowheads geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = 5, y = -0, yend = 0), arrow = arrow(type = &quot;closed&quot;, ends = &quot;both&quot;, length = unit(0.15, &quot;inches&quot;)), linewidth = 1.2) + # Critical points geom_point(aes(x = 1, y = 0), size = 3) + geom_point(aes(x = 3, y = 0), size = 3) + # Labels just above the line annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 1, y = 0.07, label = &quot;1 (critical point)&quot;, hjust = 0.5) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 3, y = 0.07, label = &quot;3 (critical point)&quot;, hjust = 0.5) + # Interval labels just below the line annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 0.5, y = -0.07, label = &quot;A&quot;, color = &quot;blue&quot;) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 2, y = -0.07, label = &quot;B&quot;, color = &quot;forestgreen&quot;) + annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 4, y = -0.07, label = &quot;C&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1, 1))+ theme_void() These divide the number line into three intervals: Interval A: \\((-\\infty, 1)\\) Interval B: \\((1, 3)\\) Interval C: \\((3, \\infty)\\) 5.4.4.1 Choose Test Point* For each interval, pick a test value (any number in the interval) and substitute it into each factor to determine the sign. Let’s use: \\(t = 0\\) for Interval A \\(t = 2\\) for Interval B \\(t = 4\\) for Interval C 5.4.5 Step-by-Step Sign Analysis Interval Test Point \\(t - 1\\) \\(t - 3\\) Product of Factors Multiply by \\(-3\\) Sign of \\(P&#39;(t)\\) Behavior of \\(P(t)\\) \\(t &lt; 1\\) 0 \\(-1\\) \\(-3\\) \\((+)\\) \\(-\\) Negative Decreasing \\(1 &lt; t &lt; 3\\) 2 \\(+1\\) \\(-1\\) \\(-\\) \\(+\\) Positive Increasing \\(t &gt; 3\\) 4 \\(+3\\) \\(+1\\) \\(+\\) \\(-\\) Negative Decreasing 5.4.5.1 How the Signs Work For \\(P&#39;(t) = -3(t - 1)(t - 3)\\): Evaluate each factor at the test point: For example, at \\(t = 0\\), \\(t - 1 = -1\\), \\(t - 3 = -3\\) Determine the sign of each factor: Two negative numbers multiplied give a positive Include the leading coefficient: We have a -3 multiplied by the product of the factors. So, \\(-3 \\cdot (+) = -\\), meaning the derivative is negative Interpret: A negative derivative means the original function \\(P(t)\\) is decreasing A positive derivative means it is increasing 5.4.5.2 Interpret the Chart At \\(t = 1\\): The function switches from decreasing to increasing, so this is a local minimum. At \\(t = 3\\): The function switches from increasing to decreasing, so this is a local maximum. 5.4.6 Step 4: Evaluate the Function Now that we’ve identified the critical points at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 3\\), we can find the population values at those times by plugging them into the original function: \\[ P(t) = -t^3 + 6t^2 - 9t + 20 \\] 5.4.6.1 At \\(t = 1\\): \\[ P(1) = -(1)^3 + 6(1)^2 - 9(1) + 20 = -1 + 6 - 9 + 20 = 16 \\] 5.4.6.2 At \\(t = 3\\): \\[ P(3) = -(3)^3 + 6(3)^2 - 9(3) + 20 = -27 + 54 - 27 + 20 = 20 \\] So: \\((1, 16)\\) is a local minimum \\((3, 20)\\) is a local maximum Now let’s update the plot to reflect this, with: Dashed horizontal lines showing the population value at each critical point Labels showing the full \\((t, P(t))\\) coordinates P &lt;- function(t) -t^3 + 6*t^2 - 9*t + 20 curve(P(x), from = 0, to = 5, ylim = c(0, 25), col = &quot;forestgreen&quot;, lwd = 2, xlab = &quot;Time (t)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Population P(t)&quot;, main = &quot;Cubic Model with Extrema&quot;) # Critical point coordinates t1 &lt;- 1 t2 &lt;- 3 P1 &lt;- P(t1) P2 &lt;- P(t2) # Mark critical points points(t1, P1, pch = 19, col = &quot;blue&quot;) points(t2, P2, pch = 19, col = &quot;red&quot;) # Dashed horizontal lines at population values abline(h = c(P1, P2), lty = 2, col = &quot;gray60&quot;) # Dashed vertical lines at t-values abline(v = c(t1, t2), lty = 2, col = &quot;gray70&quot;) # Labels text(t1, P1 + 1.5, labels = &quot;Local Min\\n(1, 16)&quot;, col = &quot;blue&quot;, pos = 3) text(t2, P2 , labels = &quot;Local Max\\n(3, 20)&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;, pos = 3) 5.4.7 Final Takeaways Use the factored form of the derivative—it makes sign analysis much easier. Pick one value per interval to test—this is enough to determine the sign throughout that interval. Include the leading coefficient in your sign analysis—it can flip the sign of the whole expression! The sign of \\(P&#39;(t)\\) tells you whether the original function \\(P(t)\\) is increasing or decreasing in that interval. The first derivative sign chart helps us identify what type of a extreme value (max or min) we have at the critical points. ##Second Derivative Sign Charts: Understanding Concavity Just like the first derivative tells us whether a function is increasing or decreasing, the second derivative tells us about the curvature of the function—also known as concavity. 5.4.8 What Does the Second Derivative Tell Us? If we think of the graph of a function as a hilly landscape: Concave Up: Looks like a valley (opens upward) → The slope is increasing → The second derivative is positive Concave Down: Looks like a hill (opens downward) → The slope is decreasing → The second derivative is negative The second derivative tells us how the rate of change is changing. 5.4.9 How to Use a Second Derivative Sign Chart We follow similar steps as the first derivative sign chart, but with \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\): Take the second derivative of the function: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) Set \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 0\\) and solve to find possible inflection points Plot those values on a number line Pick test points in each interval to determine the sign of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) Use the sign chart to determine concavity: \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\): concave up \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\): concave down 5.5 The procedure is identical to that of the first derivative sign chart. The difference is in the interpreation of the signs. The second derivative sign chart helps us determine information about the functions convavity. 5.5.1 What Are Inflection Points? An inflection point is where the function changes concavity—from concave up to concave down or vice versa. These occur where the second derivative changes sign. Note: Not every point where \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) = 0\\) is an inflection point. The sign must actually change on either side. ####What Can We Learn? Where the function bends up or down Where the graph changes shape (inflection points) How curvature affects the behavior of the system In environmental modeling, this helps us: Understand when population growth is accelerating or decelerating Detect turning points in resource usage Identify shifts in environmental trends 5.5.1.1 Summary Interval \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\) Sign Concavity Interpretation \\(x &lt; a\\) \\(&gt; 0\\) Concave Up Slope is increasing \\(x = a\\) 0 (possible IP) — Candidate for inflection point \\(x &gt; a\\) \\(&lt; 0\\) Concave Down Slope is decreasing Use this analysis to combine with the first derivative for a complete picture of the function’s behavior. 5.6 Optimizaiton "],["calculus-i-equation-sheet.html", "Calculus I Equation Sheet", " Calculus I Equation Sheet Basic Derivative Rules Rule Function Form Derivative Form Constant \\(c\\) \\(0\\) Power \\(x^n\\) \\(n x^{n-1}\\) Constant Multiple \\(c \\cdot f(x)\\) \\(c \\cdot f&#39;(x)\\) Sum \\(f(x) + g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) + g&#39;(x)\\) Difference \\(f(x) - g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x) - g&#39;(x)\\) Product \\(f(x)g(x)\\) \\(f&#39;(x)g(x) + f(x)g&#39;(x)\\) Quotient \\(\\dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)}\\) \\(\\dfrac{f&#39;(x)g(x) - f(x)g&#39;(x)}{g(x)^2}\\) Chain \\(f(g(x))\\) \\(f&#39;(g(x)) \\cdot g&#39;(x)\\) Inverse \\(f^{-1}(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{f&#39;(f^{-1}(x))}\\) Trigonometric Derivatives Function Derivative \\(\\sin x\\) \\(\\cos x\\) \\(\\cos x\\) \\(-\\sin x\\) \\(\\tan x\\) \\(\\sec^2 x\\) \\(\\sec x\\) \\(\\sec x \\tan x\\) \\(\\csc x\\) \\(-\\csc x \\cot x\\) \\(\\cot x\\) \\(-\\csc^2 x\\) Exponential &amp; Logarithmic Derivatives Function Derivative \\(a^x\\) \\(a^x \\ln(a)\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(e^x\\) \\(a^{g(x)}\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\, a^{g(x)} \\ln(a)\\) \\(e^{g(x)}\\) \\(g&#39;(x)\\, e^{g(x)}\\) \\(\\log_a(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{x \\ln(a)}\\) \\(\\ln(x)\\) \\(\\dfrac{1}{x}\\) \\(\\log_a(g(x))\\) \\(\\dfrac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)\\ln(a)}\\) \\(\\ln(g(x))\\) \\(\\dfrac{g&#39;(x)}{g(x)}\\) Average Rate of Change \\[ AV_[a,b] = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] Limit Definition of a Derivative \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] General Functions &amp; Forms Linear Forms: General: \\(f(x) = ax+b\\), Point-slope: \\(y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)\\), Slope-intercept: \\(y=mx+b\\) Quadratic Forms: General: \\(ax^2+bx+c\\), Vertex: \\(a(x-h)^2+k\\), Roots: \\(\\dfrac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\) Polynomial (nth-order): \\(f(x) = a_nx^n + \\dots + a_1x + a_0\\) Transformations: \\(g(x) = a f(x-b) + c\\) Sinusoid: \\(f(x) = a \\sin(kx+b)+c,\\ \\ T=\\dfrac{2\\pi}{k}\\) Applications Slope of tangent line: \\(m = f&#39;(a)\\) Tangent line equation: \\(y = f&#39;(a)(x-a)+f(a)\\) Linear approximation: \\(L(x)=f(a)+f&#39;(a)(x-a)\\) Related rates: \\(\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = \\dfrac{dy}{dx}\\cdot\\dfrac{dx}{dt}\\) Concavity: \\(f&#39;&#39;&gt;0 \\Rightarrow\\) concave up, \\(f&#39;&#39;&lt;0 \\Rightarrow\\) concave down Extrema: solve \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\), check sign of \\(f&#39;\\) or use \\(f&#39;&#39;\\) "],["test-review-material.html", "Test Review Material Test Instructions Test 1 Spring 2025 Test 1 Spring 2025 Retake Test 1 Winter 2025 Practice Workbook: Limits, Continuity, and Derivatives Short-Answer Practice Problem Practice", " Test Review Material Below are resources to help you practice and prepare for the tests in this course Test 1 will cover the material covered in Chapter 3 of this textbook.

We will be using Poll everywhere Ask questions – but please be respectful of all voices and views - wrong answers have more value than right ones! 6.3 Why are you here?

What should you find someone else for? 6.7 Syllabus Highlights 6.7.1 Assessments Preparation and Participation [20%] Before class readings/questions In-class activities After-class self checks Homeworks [10%] Roughly every week Revise and resubmit Grade on accuracy and effort Tests [60%] 4 Tests over the term 2 can be re-taken during finals week 1 pg of notes (2sides) Project [10%] Low stakes group project applying the big picture concepts of this class Focuses on reading and interpreting the math Class discussion Why do you think there is so much weight on tests and participation? 6.7.2 Acedemic Integrity This class has been designed to reward you for doing your own work Tests will be relatively straightforward if you make the effort on the in-class and homework assessments Using these resources will only make studying for tests harder. Many of these resources give you the illusion of understanding - but the reality is quite different. 6.7.3 Late Assessment / Missed Assessment Policy This is a firm policy to make sure I am being fair to all of you. Grace period: Homeworks for this class are due Friday at 11:59pm. Homeworks will be accepted 72 hrs after their due date with no penalty (Monday 11:59pm). Graded work not turned in by this time will receive a grade of zero. Missed Tests: If you miss a test, you will need to use one of your ‘re-takes’ during finals weeks to do it. However, if you have a legitimate reason, I will work with you to reschedule the test earlier so you can save your re-take. Missed Class Preparation/Participation: From time to time we miss class for several reasons (studying for another test that day, field work, illness, etc). There will be no opportunity to submit preparation and participation activities if they are missed. The purpose of these activities are to reinforce concepts in the moment – and have little value out the context of the material being covered that day. To accommodate for this, 5% of the total preparation and participation assessments will be dropped. There will also be additional extra-credit opportunities throughout the term. Exceptional Circumstances: You must contact me 48 hours before the actual due date (not after the 48hr grace period) of a graded assignment to give me advanced notice, or within 12 hours after the work is due in the case of an emergency. If you fail to do this, you will receive zero credit for the missed assignment. Class Discussion What do we consider exceptional circumstances? 6.7.4 Test Retakes Policy There is no Final in this class – BUT – I will use the finals timeslot for the retakes. So don’t plan an early break if you think you might be doing a retake. If you miss a test during the term for a valid reason (health, emergency etc) and inform me in a timely manner, I’ll schedule a time during office hours for you to take the test. This flexibility is only good for a couple of days as I want to get the graded tests back to the rest of the class. If you miss a test for another reason (slept in, went to a wedding etc) you can always use one of your retakes – that’s what they are for. Reasons to retake Missed a test Want to try for a better grade Love calc so much you want to do more problems You can retake upto 2 tests. Your best score counts – so no risk 6.7.5 Office Hours Please select ALL times that could work. I will always try to hang around for 30mins or so after class to answer any questions. Office hours will be posted on Canvas as soon as they are set. 6.7.6 Class notes All notes that I take in class are available on the onenote notebook link on Canvas All lectures will be recorded - these will also be made available on Canvas From time to time the technology will fail us. Remember these are being provided as a bonus. There is no substitute for attending class and taking your own notes. 6.8 Questions? Class discussion Ask me anything - whats on your mind - need clarification on any of the things we’ve talked about? 6.9 Paper Planes Paper Plane Activity We are going to make paper planes and then see how well they fly. We are going to break into 4 groups: Group 1: Instructions not included – I know how to make a paper plane already Group 2: Notes - Watch the video multiple times, pausing and taking notes – I’m confident I can make a good plane Group 3: Team – Work together and make 1 TEAM plane. Group 4: Solo first + then team up - Make your own plane, then make a team plane Discussion Why did we make paper planes in calc? 6.10 Rate of Change - A First Look Class Discussion When we try to understand derivatives, the most common place to start is Position-&gt;Velocity-&gt;Acceleration and how they are linked. Lets have a look at this while watching Usain Bolt run the 100m in 9.69s While we watch this video I want you to keep in mind the idea of change - what variables are changing as we move through this race. Usain Bolt 100m Record Group Discussion How fast did he run? Can you calculate it? What was the fastest he ran? OR what was his top speed (velocity)? When do you think this happened? 3)The time it took him to get to 10m markers was measured, and the plot is below. What does this tell us about how fast he ran? 4)If we fit a smooth curve to this path, instead of looking at the slope over every 10m, we can look at the instantaneous rate of change or the derivative at any point. Note: The reason the curve needs to be smooth will be covered later - this is all just a preview No if we calculate the instantaneous rate of change and plot it against time - we get the velocity vs time relationship. Using this - try to describe how is velocity (speed) varied during the race. The world wondered how fast he could actually run the 100m. A year later at the world championships sensors were places along the tract to capture in high resolution his position with time. What do you notice this time? What is causing the oscillating in the red line?

Track units through computations and check results for reasonableness. Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of time and elevation. It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice. This chapter is designed to help you review and refresh the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a toolbox: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher. 7.1.1 ✏️ Reflection Prompt Which of these objectives feels most familiar to you? Which one do you think will be the biggest challenge? 7.2 Notes: 7.3 What You’re Expected to Know To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with: Working with functions and interpreting graphs Manipulating algebraic equations Rules for exponents and logarithms Understanding and converting units Reading and setting up word problems If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal.

Put a star next to the ones you’d like extra practice with. Notes: 7.4 How to Approach Calculus Problems Calculus is about making sense of change. Use these steps as a guide when solving problems. 7.4.1 Analogy Prompt:Planning a Hike Think about the the process of planning a hike What decisions do you make to undertake this task? How do you weigh different factors? What “tools” do you already have that help you make choices? How might this be similar to the way we’ll approach calculus problems? Notes: 7.4.2 Clarify the Ask Prompt: What are we trying to answer - define the questions in your own terms. Notes: 7.4.3 List the Givens Prompt: List the variables, units, and known values. Make a quick sketch if it helps. Notes: 7.4.4 Translate the Math Prompt: Can you think of an equation that might be helpful for this problem? Think about what each term means in your own words? Notes: 7.4.5 Work Step by Step Practice: Solve the simple problem, but explain each step: What did you do? Why? What does the result mean? Then think about complexity: What assumptions did I make that weren’t realistic Notes: 7.4.6 Reflect and Interpret Prompt: Does your result make sense? Are the units correct? Is the magnitude reasonable? What does it say about the system? Notes: 7.4.7 Growth Mindset Reflection: What’s one strategy you’ll try when you get stuck? Write it here as a reminder. Notes: 7.5 How We Communicate Relationships Functions describe how one quantity depends on another. We can show this relationship in different ways: Words Graphs Tables Equations Each representation tells the story differently. Some make patterns clear, others make calculations easy. 7.5.1 Your Turn Practice: Describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Try using each representation: Write a short statement in words. Sketch or imagine a graph. Create a small table of values. Suggest a simple equation. Then reflect: - What are the pros/cons of each method? - What do you gain or lose when switching representations? Notes: 7.5.2 Discussion Prompt Practice: Air temperature usually drops as you climb a mountain (the “lapse rate”). How would you represent this relationship in words, graphs, tables, and equations? If the lapse rate is about 6.5 °C per 1000 m, what temperature do you predict at Mount Rainier’s summit (4392 m) if it’s 18 °C at sea level? What does the slope of your function represent? Notes: 7.6 Functions and Their Representations Functions are input–output machines: you put something in, apply a rule, and get something out. They can be written in many forms, but always represent a relationship. 7.6.1 Understanding \\(f(x)\\) Practice: What does \\(f(x)\\) mean in your own words? Identify the input, the rule, and the output in a function. Give one real-world example of a function you’ve seen. Notes: 7.6.2 Meaningful Names Practice: Lets look at two functions: a generic function like \\(f(x) = 0.2x + 3\\) \\(T(d) = 0.2d +3\\) where d is distance from the shore and T is the land temperature What are the differences between these two functions? How does changing the variable names affect interpretation? How does changing the variable names change the results? Notes: 7.6.3 Multiple Inputs Practice: Think of an environmental process that depends on more than one variable. Write a function with two inputs (e.g., \\(T(t,h)\\) for temperature as a function of time and elevation). What do each of the variables and parameters represent? Which variables might you ignore to keep the model simple? Notes: 7.6.4 Activity: Growth of a Tree Prompt: In a group, discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree. Write a pseudo-equation in the form \\[\\text{Growth} = f(\\text{Variable 1}, \\text{Variable 2}, \\ldots) \\] How many variables drive tree growth? Which ones would you include first in a simple model? Notes: 7.6.5 Activity: Modeling Temperature Practice: We can model temperature as a function of time and elevation: Start with a daily cycle at sea level. Adjust with the lapse rate (–6.5 °C per 1000 m). Combine them into \\(T(t,h)\\). Reflect: At what time of day is the difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest? What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases? Which variable (time or elevation) has the stronger effect in your model? Notes: 7.6.6 Activity: Telling the Story of a Complex Equation Practice: Consider the following model for photosynthesis in a plant canopy: \\[ A(t, I, T) = A_{\\max} \\cdot \\frac{I}{I + K} \\cdot e^{-0.01(T - 25)^2} \\cdot (1 - e^{-0.1t}) \\] Where: - \\(A(t, I, T)\\) = photosynthesis rate (µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) - \\(A_{\\max}\\) = maximum photosynthesis capacity - \\(I\\) = light intensity (µmol photons m⁻² s⁻¹) - \\(K\\) = half-saturation constant for light - \\(T\\) = temperature (°C) - \\(t\\) = time since sunrise (hours) Prompt: Tell the story of this equation in plain language. How does each factor (light, temperature, time) influence photosynthesis? Which parts of the equation act like limits or controls? What would happen if one variable stayed constant while the others changed? Notes: Seeing math as a complex story rather than symbols is a key to building mathematical literacy 7.7 Graphing and Interpreting Change 7.7.1 Key Ideas to Explore When is a function increasing or decreasing? Where are the peaks and valleys? How does the graph bend (concavity)? How do these patterns connect to environmental systems? 7.7.2 Practice Reading a Graph Activity: Look at a graph of a quadratic function (or sketch one). Figure 7.1: Quadratic function for practice: Where is it increasing or decreasing? Where is it increasing? Where is it decreasing? How do you know when the slope is positive, zero, or negative? What real-world system might this graph represent? Notes: 7.7.3 The Ball Analogy Discussion Prompt: Imagine throwing a ball straight up in the air. Figure 7.2: Empty axes for sketching height vs. time. Try to sketch the vertical position of the ball through time. When is it rising? When is it at its peak? When is it falling? How does the slope of the height vs. time graph change throughout? Notes: 7.7.4 Cubic Example Practice: Consider the function \\(f(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 9x + 2\\). Figure 7.3: Cubic function example with turning points. Where is the function increasing? Where is it decreasing? Where does it reach local maxima and minima? How does the concavity change (curving up vs curving down)? What real-world process might this model - can you tell a story? Notes: 7.7.5 Connecting Math to Environment Practice: Sketch or imagine a graph for each of these: A river’s flow during a flood event The daily temperature cycle (morning to night) The growth of algae in a lake after a nutrient spill For each: Where is it increasing/decreasing? Where would you expect peaks or valleys? How does concavity help tell the story? Notes: 7.8 Key Function Types Here are some of the most common function types you’ll see in environmental systems: Function Type Form Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing steadily over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species population growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH scale or sound intensity 7.8.1 Explore the Shapes Practice: Sketch the graphs of linear, quadratic, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Figure 7.4: Clean blank axes without labels for sketching. How do they look different? Which ones keep increasing forever? Which ones turn around? What about curvature? Notes: 7.8.2 Match Functions to Situations Activity: Match each situation to a function type: Forest biomass after a fire The concentration of a chemical spill as you move downstream. A sea level over time. Notes: 7.8.3 Extend to Your Own Examples Discussion Prompt: Think of two environmental processes you know about (from ecology, hydrology, climate, etc.). Which function type might describe each process? What clues in the process tell you that? What would you expect the graph to look like? Notes: 7.9 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units tell the story of your math. They help you avoid mistakes, interpret results, and check reasonableness. 7.9.1 Why Units Matter Practice: Consider the formula for streamflow: \\[ Q = A \\cdot v \\] Where: - \\(Q\\) = streamflow - \\(A\\) = cross-sectional area - \\(v\\) = velocity ) Write typical units for each of the variables. Do the units on both sides of the equation match? If not, what needs to change? Notes: 7.9.2 Mars Climate Orbiter (Unit Mismatch) Prompt: A famous NASA mission failed because one team used English units and another used metric. Where in your work could a mismatch like that happen? What quick unit checks could catch it? Notes: I hope you’ve never made a mistake that cost you $300M+ 7.9.3 Average Rate of Change (CO₂ Example) Practice: Atmospheric CO₂ increases from 400 ppm to 420 ppm over 5 years. 1) Compute the average rate of change (include units). 2) Repeat without numbers — use only symbols/units. 3) Interpret: What does your rate mean in words? Notes: 7.9.4 Build a Rate From Units Only Practice: You measure rainfall in mm over hours. Form a meaningful rainfall rate using just the units (no numbers). What does that rate tell you physically? Think of situations where that rate would be useful. Notes: 7.9.5 Rate Sense-Check Prompt: You computed a melt rate of a glacier as 3 m/day. Is that reasonable? Why or why not? What additional context would help you check it? Propose a more plausible order of magnitude and justify it. Notes: 7.9.6 Word Problem → Math → Story Practice: “A lake’s algae concentration rises by a constant amount each day.” Define variables with units. Write a simple function that models this. Compute the average rate over a week. Tell the story of your function in plain English. Notes: 7.10 Getting Comfortable with Word Problems Word problems are about translation: turning words into math and then back into real-world meaning. 7.10.1 Reading Word Problems 7.10.2 Glacier Example Practice: A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What’s changing? Is the rate constant or variable? What kind of function might model this (linear, quadratic, exponential)? What would a graph of this look like? Notes: 7.10.3 Build Your Own Word Problem Activity: Think of another environmental situation where the rate of change itself is changing. Write your own short word problem and sketch how you’d model it. Notes: 7.11 Skills Drills These drills are for extra practice.

How can you interpret a derivative from a graph, dataset, or equation? What does derivative notation mean, and how does it connect to context? How could you apply derivatives to a real-world environmental example? Notes: 8.2 Understanding the Speed of Change A derivative is about how fast something is changing, right now, and in what direction. 8.2.1 Class Brainstorm: What’s Changing? Activity: Shared Google Doc As a group, pick an environmental system you are interested in (e.g. Lake Washington). Discuss: What quantity is changing in that system? What is it changing with respect to (time, distance, depth, etc.)? Why might the speed of change matter for scientists, managers, or communities? Rinse and repeat, can you think of another quantity or variable that is changing in your system? Share your group’s example with the class. Notes: 8.2.2 Average vs Right-Now: Build the Contrast Practice: Using your scenario: What average rate of change could you compute between two times? What would the instantaneous rate tell you “right now”? How would the decisions based on these two rates differ? Notes: 8.2.3 Graph Interpretation: Slope as a Story Activity (no equations needed): Sketch a simple curve of your quantity vs. its input (e.g., population vs. time).

Notes: 8.3 Why We Need New Math Tools 8.3.1 Compare: Snapshots vs. Speed Activity (Whole Class Scenario + Small Groups): Scenario: A coastal city is monitoring sea level rise to plan future flood defenses. Snapshot: “Sea level is currently 1.2 meters above the baseline.” Speed: “Sea level is rising at 4 mm per year.” Step 1: Snapshot vs. Speed What can the snapshot alone tell the city planners? What critical information is missing if they only have the snapshot? How does the speed of change alter the urgency of decisions? Step 2: Consequences of Missing Information If planners only use the snapshot, what mistakes could they make? If they only use the speed, what context would be missing? Why do they need both? Step 3: Push Further How would decisions differ if the speed of rise is constant vs. accelerating? What additional data (short-term vs. long-term) would make predictions more reliable? Step 4: Generalize Complete this sentence as a group: In environmental systems, a snapshot tells us ________, but the derivative tells us ________. Notes: 8.4 What Is A Derivative? You’ve probably seen derivatives before—even if you didn’t call them that. If you’ve ever looked at how fast something was growing, declining, or shifting in space or time, you’ve already been thinking about derivatives. Table 8.1: Terms Across Disciplines That Represent Derivatives Math…Physics…Data…Context Environmental…Applied…Context Rate of change Growth rate Slope of the tangent line Decay rate Instantaneous rate Reaction rate Velocity Flux Acceleration Turnover rate Gradient Loss rate / Gain rate Marginal change Change per unit time Slope at a point Response rate Rise over run Uptake rate Delta Y / Delta X First difference Mathematically, the derivative describes the instantaneous rate of change—the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point. 8.4.1 Derivative Notation: Speaking the Language of Change In calculus, there are several common notations used to represent the derivative—the instantaneous rate of change of a function. Understanding these notations is key to reading and writing mathematics fluently, especially when interpreting real-world problems in environmental science. 8.4.1.1 Common Derivative Notations Let’s say we have a function, we could right this as: \\[ f(x) = something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\\\ y= something\\ with\\ x&#39;s \\ in\\ it \\] We can then write the notation of the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) in several ways, all of which mean exactly the same thing: Notation Spoken As Description \\(f&#39;(x)\\) “f prime of x” Most compact form; often used in textbooks \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\) “dee y over dee x” Emphasizes that \\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\); Leibniz notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx} f(x)\\) “dee by dee x of f of x” Shows that differentiation is an operation \\(D_x f(x)\\) “D sub x of f of x” Operator form used in some texts \\(y&#39;\\) “y prime” Used when \\(y = f(x)\\), common in applied settings Prime notation: e.g., \\(f&#39;(x)\\), \\(g&#39;(t)\\) Leibniz notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\), \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) Operator notation: e.g., \\(\\frac{d}{dx}(f(x))\\), applying \\(\\frac{d}{dt}\\) to an expression 8.4.1.2 The Derivative as an Operator The notation \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is not just a symbol—it’s an operator. That means it acts on a function to produce another function: the derivative. Think of it this way: The symbol \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\) is a command: “Take the derivative of whatever comes after this with respect to \\(x\\).” So if you write: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) \\] You are instructing the reader (or yourself!) to differentiate the expression \\(3x^2 + 2x\\) with respect to \\(x\\). The result: \\[ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(3x^2 + 2x\\right) = 6x + 2 \\] 8.4.2 Snapshots vs speed of change We’ve seen examples where snapshots (a single measurement) and speed (how fast something changes) both matter. The derivative is the mathematical tool that lets us capture that “speed of change” precisely. 8.4.3 Spot the Derivative in Disguise Activity (Pairs or Small Groups): Below are phrases from different fields. Circle or underline the ones that represent a rate of change — in other words, a derivative in disguise. A glacier loses 2 km² of area per year Dissolved oxygen drops by 1 mg/L per meter of depth Tree canopy cover increases by 5% per kilometer toward the city center The tide is rising at 5 cm per hour Soil carbon decreases by 0.3 g per kilogram of soil nitrogen Ocean salinity is 34 parts per million Ocean salinity increases by 0.2 ppt per 100 km toward the equator CO₂ levels are increasing by 2.5 ppm per year A lake is 12°C in July Mountain snowpack decreases by 10 cm per 100 m of elevation gain The pH of a stream is 6.5 The pH of a stream drops by 0.1 units per kilometer downstream of a mine Forest biomass is 400 tons of carbon per hectare Forest biomass has been increasing by 3 tons per hectare per year Wind speed increases by 0.5 m/s per 10 m of height Annual rainfall totals 1200 mm Rainfall intensity rises by 2 mm per minute during a storm Nitrogen leaching is 4 kg/ha Nitrogen leaching rises by 0.1 kg per mm of irrigation applied Discuss: - Which are true derivatives? - Which are just static descriptions or ratios? - How can you tell the difference? Notes: 8.4.4 Tell the Story of the Math Activity (Whole Class): Consider the formula: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\] What do the symbols mean in plain language? How does this formula connect to “rise over run” from algebra? How could you explain this to a high school student using a real-world environmental example? Notes: 8.4.5 Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: A derivative is not just a formula — it’s a way of describing ________. Notes: 8.5 Average Rate of Change The average rate of change tells us how much something changes per unit of input (like time, distance, or depth) over a chosen interval. Mathematically, it’s the slope of a secant line connecting two points on a function. 8.5.1 Practice: Secant Slope on a Graph Activity (Individual or Pairs): Look at the quadratic function below. \\[f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5\\] Pick two points on the curve. Estimate their coordinates. Use the formula below to compute the average rate of change. \\[\\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\\] What does the sign of your slope tell you about how the function is changing? Write a descriptive sentence about what your value represents Notes: 8.5.2 Practice: Environmental Table Activity (Small Groups): The table below shows the amount of carbon stored in forest soil over time. Year Carbon (kg/m²) 2000 4.1 2005 4.8 2010 5.0 Compute the average rate of change from 2000 to 2005. Compute the average rate of change from 2005 to 2010. Compute the average rate of change from 2000 to 2010. Write one or two sentences explaining what these numbers mean in the context of carbon storage. Notes: 8.5.3 Practice: Application to Sea Level Activity (Whole Class Discussion): Suppose sea level in a coastal region is modeled by \\[S(t) = 3.2t + 45\\] where \\(S(t)\\) is in millimeters and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Calculate the average rate of change of \\(S(t)\\) from 2010 to 2020. State the units of your result. Interpret the meaning: what does this tell us about sea level trends? Is there a shortcut to finding the average rate of change? Visualize this function with a sketch, add in the secant line, what do you notice? Notes: Environmentla Application - A Visual View Discussion Questions Describe the Trend What does the plot tell you about how global sea level has changed since 1993? Is the trend linear, exponential, or something else? Estimate the Average Rate of Change Pick two points on the black line (e.g., between 1993 and 2025) to estimate: \\[ \\text{Average Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Sea Level (mm)}}{\\text{Change in Time (years)}} \\] What units does your answer have? Interpret in Context What does your calculated rate tell you about sea level rise? Why is knowing the average rate important for cities, communities, and planners? Explore Acceleration Estimate the average rate of change over each 5-year interval below by reading approximate values from the graph. Use the formula: \\[ \\text{Avg. Rate} = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Sea Level}}{\\Delta \\text{Time}} \\quad \\text{(in mm/year)} \\] Fill in the table: Time Interval Sea Level at Start (mm) Sea Level at End (mm) Avg. Rate (mm/year) 1995–2000 2000–2005 2005–2010 2010–2015 2015–2020 2020–2025 What do you notice about how the average rate changes over time? What does that suggest about the acceleration of sea level rise? Connect to Derivatives If this were a smooth function \\(S(t)\\) representing sea level at year \\(t\\), what would the derivative \\(S&#39;(t)\\) represent? What would a plot of the average rate of change look like? What would happen if we looked at the average rate of change over shorter and shorter periods? How would this chang the way a plot of the rate of change look like? Reflection Prompt Describe a situation in your area of interest (marine biology, forestry, climate science, etc.) where an average rate of change is used. What does it tell you, and what might it leave out? 8.6 Instantaneous Rate of Change The instantaneous rate of change tells us how fast something is changing at a specific moment. Unlike the average rate, which looks at an interval, the instantaneous rate captures the slope of the tangent line at a single point. This is the essence of a derivative. 8.6.1 Zooming In on Change Activity (Whole Class Demonstration): Look at the function below. As a class, discuss: What does the slope of the curve at 2010 represent? Imagine drawing a tangent line right at that point. How is this different from a secant line? How might the meaning of this slope change if this were a glacier, a population, or a pollutant concentration? Notes: 8.6.2 Tangent Hunt Activity (Pairs): On the curve below: Mark one point where the tangent slope is clearly positive. Mark one point where the tangent slope is clearly negative. Mark one point where the tangent slope is zero. When does the sign of the tangent slope change? Where is change happening the fastest? (positive and negative) Discuss: What does each slope mean in an environmental context (e.g., population peak, fastest growth, fastest decline)? Break up the function into regions and tell a story. Notes: Challenge: Can you sketch the derivative - dont worry about getting the right magnitudes, just the right shape. [Hint: start with some points you know for sure, then ask yourself as you move left to right what is happening to the slope] 8.6.3 Practice: Bear Growth Scenario Activity (Small Groups): Imagine tracking the weight of a bear throughout its life. Sketch or imagine the weight vs. age curve. Where is the slope (rate of change) steepest? Where does the slope flatten out? Could it ever become negative? Group Discussion: Why might wildlife managers care about whether the rate of weight gain is accelerating or decelerating? Notes: Now try sketching the derivative, or the rate of change of the bear’s weight. 8.6.4 From a’s and b’s to a’s and h’s Changing our frame of reference \\[ \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} = \\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] 8.6.5 Data to Derivative Activity (Hands-On, with Data Table): You measure dissolved oxygen in a lake for three consecutive days: Day DO (mg/L) 4.0 8.15 5.0 8.10 6.0 8.05 Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at Day 4, 5 and 6 using the formula: \\[f&#39;(a) \\approx \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\\] with \\(h = 1\\). Interpret your result in context, including units. Was it possible to calculate the instantaneous rate of change at day 6? How would a higher-resolution dataset (more frequent measurements) improve your estimate? Notes: REMEMBER: We are just estimating here! If h is small enough its a good estimate, if h is big, well it becomes the ‘average’ rate of change. Discuss: Is this more of an average or instantaneous rate of change? 8.6.6 Instantaneous vs. Average Activity (Class Discussion): Compare these two statements: A glacier retreats 20 meters per year between 2000 and 2010. On January 1st 2005, the glacier front is moving backward at 3.5 meters per year. Which is an average rate? Which is instantaneous? What added information do you get (or can deduce) when you have both pieces of information? Why does the distinction matter for scientists, policymakers, or communities? Brainstorm 2–3 other examples where average vs. instantaneous rates tell very different stories. Notes: 8.7 The Limit Definition of a Derivative We don’t do many proofs in this class, but understanding the mathematical origins of the derivative really helps with interpretation. So we will work through this one together. 8.7.1 Deriving the Limit Definition with a Real Example — Seattle Daylight We’ll use a simple model of daylight hours in Seattle (approx. 47.6°N) to build the derivative from limits. A realistic sinusoidal model for daylight hours \\(D(t)\\) (in hours) on day \\(t\\) of the year is: \\[ D(t) \\;=\\; 12.25 \\;+\\; 3.75 \\,\\cos\\!\\Big(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{365}\\,(t - 172)\\Big) \\] Midline \\(\\approx 12.25\\) hours Amplitude \\(\\approx 3.75\\) hours Let’s first build an intuition for what daylight hours look like over a year in Seattle. Sketch what you think the curve looks like (peak near late June, minimum near late December), then compare to the model above. Annotate interesting points along this function. 8.7.2 Connect to the Question Activity (Think-Pair-Share): Lets pick a specific day \\(a=250\\) (day 250 ≈ early Sep). What does \\(D(a)\\) represent in words? If you only know \\(D(a)\\) and \\(D(a+h)\\), how would you estimate “how fast daylight is changing around day \\(a\\)” using the average rate of change? Why might we want the instantaneous rate of change instead? Notes: 8.7.3 From Average to Instant: The Difference Quotient Step 1 — Average Rate on \\([a, a+h]\\): Write the average rate of change of daylight hours between day \\(a\\) and day \\(a+h\\) where \\(h=10\\): Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250 13.26 260 12.61 270 11.96 \\[ \\frac{D(a+h) - D(a)}{h} \\] What does the numerator represent in context? What are the units of this average rate? Notes: Step 2 — Shrink the Interval: To get the rate “right now” on day \\(a\\), we take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ D&#39;(a) \\;=\\; \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{D(a+h) - D(a)}{h} \\] So if we use the data below we can see we are shrinking our \\(h\\) getting it close to \\(0\\). Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250 13.259 251 13.195 252 13.131 Calculate the average rate of change with an \\(h=1\\) What if we shrink the interval even further and make \\(h=0.01\\) Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250.00 13.259240 250.01 13.258602 250.02 13.257965 Why can’t we just set \\(h=0\\) directly? In words, what does this limit do with the two-day comparison? Notes: Challenge: In your groups discuss this table, what do you notice on both ends of the table? h Average Rate of Change (hrs/day) 365 0.000000 300 0.009487 200 -0.002907 100 -0.046478 50 -0.062121 10 -0.064676 1 -0.063844 0.1 -0.063732 0.01 -0.063721 0.001 -0.063720 0.00001 -0.063720 Technically what have found here is an estimate for the instantanous rate of change at a point 8.7.4 Visualizing Secant \\(\\to\\) Tangent (Seattle Daylight) Using the plot below, sketch: The secant at day 250 with \\(h=365\\) Now draw another secant with \\(h=300\\) Now draw it with \\(h=50\\) Finally sketch the tangent at \\(h=250\\) Remember the average rate of change equation is just rise over run or the slope of the secant lines, so the slopes of the lines are what tell us the rate of change 8.7.5 Read What the Slope Means Interpretation: Using your numerical/visual estimate of \\(D&#39;(a)\\): If \\(D&#39;(a) &gt; 0\\), what does that say about the season and daylight change? If \\(D&#39;(a) &lt; 0\\), what time of year might that correspond to? If \\(D&#39;(a) \\approx 0\\), what’s happening seasonally? Notes: 8.7.6 Why Limits Matter (Wrap-Up) Prompt: Explain—in your own words—why the limit is essential for defining the instantaneous rate of change, using the Seattle daylight model as your example. Notes: 8.8 Introducing Limit Notation We now need a way to formalize what happens as we “zoom in” on a function — this is where the idea of a limit comes in. 8.8.1 Building Intuition Activity (Think-Pair-Share): Imagine a pollutant concentration in a river, \\(C(x)\\), as you move downstream toward a factory outfall. At 0.9 km downstream, \\(C = 4.9\\) mg/L At 0.99 km, \\(C = 4.99\\) mg/L At 0.999 km, \\(C = 4.999\\) mg/L As you move closer to 1 km, what value does the concentration seem to be approaching? This “approaching behavior” is what we call the limit. Notes: 8.8.2 Symbol and Words Practice: The formal symbol is: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\] What does the arrow (\\(\\to\\)) mean? What does the \\(a\\) represent? What is \\(f(x)\\) approaching as \\(x\\) gets closer to \\(a\\)? Notes: 8.8.3 Why Not Just Plug In? Discussion Prompt: Sometimes \\(f(a)\\) is undefined (like dividing by zero). In fact - when we look at the limit defintion of a derivative, this is the problem we encounter. \\[ f&#39;(a) \\;=\\; \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Notes: 8.8.4 One-Sided Limits Activity (Small Groups): We can approach a point from the left (\\(a^-\\)) or from the right (\\(a^+\\)). Sketch a graph where the left-hand and right-hand limits are the same. Sketch a graph where they are different. Can you link this to a real-world example? Notes: 8.9 From Average to Instantaneous: The Role of Limits We want to connect the average rate of change to the instantaneous rate of change. Start with the average rate formula: \\[ \\text{Average Rate on } [a,b] = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] 8.9.1 Scaffold the Derivation Practice (Step by Step): Start with the formula for the average rate of change between two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\[ \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] What does the numerator mean? What does the denominator mean? Introduce a new variable \\(h = b-a\\). Rewrite the denominator in terms of \\(h\\). Replace \\(b\\) with \\(a+h\\). Show that the formula becomes: \\[ \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Why is this still the average rate of change, just written differently? Try to explain this with a sketch. Now imagine shrinking the interval smaller and smaller: let \\(h \\to 0\\). This makes the slope of secant line approach the slope of the tangent line. What problem happens if you just set \\(h=0\\)? How does the limit fix this? Add in the limit notation Arrive at the definition of the derivative: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Notes: Let’s annotate this equation so we know what everything is and what to do with it. \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] 8.10 Finding the Derivative Using the Limit Definition of a Derivative We’ll now practice moving from the definition of the derivative to actually computing one. Remember, the derivative at a point \\(a\\) is defined as: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] We are going to take this one step at a time: We’ll deal with the numerator We’ll add in the fraction term We’ll add the limit 8.10.1 Step 1: Setup the equations Activity: Suppose we have the function: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] We want to find the derivative at \\(x = 2\\). Write down the limit definition of the derivative at \\(a = 2\\). Substitute \\(a = 2\\) into the formula (but don’t simplify yet). What expression do you now have? Notes: 8.10.2 Step 2: Expand the Numerator Activity: The numerator is: \\[ f(2+h) - f(2) \\] Compute \\(f(2+h)\\). Compute \\(f(2)\\). Subtract them to simplify the numerator. Write your result in expanded form. Notes: 8.10.3 Step 3: Simplify the Difference Quotient Activity: Now substitute your numerator back into: \\[ \\frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} \\] Factor/simplify if possible. What cancels out? Why is this helpful? Notes: 8.10.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: Finally, take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\). Substitute \\(h = 0\\) after simplification. What value do you get for \\(f&#39;(2)\\)? Interpret: What does this mean in terms of the slope of the tangent line? Notes: You’ve found the derivative at a point \\(a=2\\) 8.10.5 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number like 2. Start with: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Expand \\(f(x+h)\\) and subtract \\(f(x)\\). Simplify and take the limit. What is the general derivative function of \\(f(x) = x^2\\)? Notes: You’ve now found the derivative function 8.11 Workbook: More Practice with the Limit Definition Now let’s apply the same step-by-step process to two new functions. Work carefully through each scaffold — the algebra will get trickier, but the structure is the same. 8.11.1 Example 1: \\(f(x) = x^3\\) We’ll find the derivative of \\(f(x) = x^3\\) at a point, and then generalize. 8.11.1.1 Step 1: Write the Definition Activity: Start with the limit definition: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Substitute \\(f(x) = x^3\\). Don’t expand yet, just write down the expression. Notes: 8.11.1.2 Step 2: Expand Activity: - Expand \\((a+h)^3\\). - Subtract \\(a^3\\). - Simplify your numerator. Notes: 8.11.1.3 Step 3: Simplify the Fraction Activity: - Divide the numerator by \\(h\\). - Cancel common factors where possible. - What remains? Notes: 8.11.1.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: - Let \\(h \\to 0\\). - What’s left? - Interpret: What does this slope mean for the cubic function at \\(x=a\\)? Notes: 8.11.2 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number \\(a\\). What is the derivative function? Notes: 8.11.3 Example 2: \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 7x\\) This time, the function is a polynomial. Let’s find its derivative using the limit definition. 8.11.3.1 Step 1: Write the Definition Activity: - Start with: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Substitute \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 7x\\). Notes: 8.11.3.2 Step 2: Expand Activity: - Expand \\(3(a+h)^2 + 7(a+h)\\). - Subtract \\((3a^2 + 7a)\\). - Simplify your numerator. Notes: 8.11.3.3 Step 3: Simplify the Fraction Activity: - Factor out \\(h\\) from the numerator. - Cancel the denominator. - What remains? Notes: 8.11.3.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: - Let \\(h \\to 0\\). - State the result clearly as \\(f&#39;(x)\\). - Interpret: How do the terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(7x\\) each behave under differentiation? Notes: 8.11.4 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number \\(a\\). What is the derivative function? Notes: 8.11.5 Example 3: Environmental Application — Glacier Retreat Suppose the area of a glacier (in km\\(^2\\)) is modeled by: \\[ G(t) = 100 - 2t - 0.1t^2 \\] where \\(t\\) is years since 2000. We want to compute the instantaneous rate of change of glacier area at \\(t = 10\\). Practice (Small Groups): 1. Write the limit definition for \\(G&#39;(10)\\). 2. Compute \\(G(10+h)\\). 3. Subtract \\(G(10)\\). 4. Divide by \\(h\\). 5. Simplify. 6. Take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\). Discussion: - What does the sign of \\(G&#39;(10)\\) tell you about the glacier at that time? - How would you explain your result to a policymaker? Notes: Practice Given \\(f(x)=7x\\) Find an expression for the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\), using the limit definition of the derivative. Practice Given \\(f(x)=3x^2+6x+2\\) Find an expression for the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\), using the limit definition of the derivative. Practice Given \\(f(x)=27\\) Find an expression for the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\), using the limit definition of the derivative. Hard problem (because of the algebra) Given \\(f(x)=\\frac{1}{x}\\) Find an expression for the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\), using the limit definition of the derivative. Estimate vs Calculate Given \\(f(x)=e^x\\) Estimate, using the limit definition of the derivative, \\(f&#39;(1)\\). 8.12 Workbook: When Does a Derivative Exist? 8.12.1 Exploring Differentiability, Continuity, and Smoothness Before we use derivatives, we need to know when they exist. In other words, under what conditions is a function differentiable at a point? 8.12.2 Requirements for Differentiability At a point \\(x = a\\), a function \\(f\\) is differentiable if its instantaneous rate of change (the derivative) exists and is finite. Formally: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] exists and is a real number. For that limit to exist, three conditions must hold: Requirement Meaning What Can Go Wrong 1. Function is defined \\(f(a)\\) exists Hole, asymptote 2. Function is continuous \\(\\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\) Jump or removable discontinuity 3. Slope changes smoothly The left- and right-hand difference quotients approach the same finite value Corner, cusp, vertical tangent, oscillation A function is differentiable if it is defined, continuous, and smooth (no sharp turns or infinite slopes). Prompt 1: Definition and Meaning In your own words, what does it mean for a function to be differentiable? How is this related to the idea of a function being continuous and smooth? Notes: 8.12.3 Continuity: The Foundation for Differentiability A function \\(f(x)\\) is continuous at a point \\(x = a\\) if all three of the following conditions are satisfied: 1. The function is defined at \\(a\\) \\[ f(a) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Check that there’s a real number assigned to \\(f(a)\\); the point is not a hole, asymptote, or gap. Prompt 2: Sketch or describe an example of a function that is not defined at a point. What happens to continuity there? Notes: 2. The limit exists as \\(x \\to a\\) \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\text{ exists.} \\] → In practice: Approach \\(a\\) from both the left and right. If the left-hand and right-hand limits agree and are finite, the limit exists. Prompt 3: Give an example where the left-hand and right-hand limits are different. How does this affect continuity? Notes: 3. The limit equals the function value \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → In practice: Compare the numerical (or graphical) limit you found with the actual value of \\(f(a)\\). If they match, the function is continuous at that point. Task A — Classify each panel (1–9): For each graph, decide whether the function is continuous within the region shown on the graph. If it is not continuous, label the failure type: Removable (hole / mismatched value) Jump Infinite (vertical asymptote) Oscillation (no limiting value) Task B — Multiple issues: Some panels show more than one issue in the same figure. List all points of discontinuity and classify each one. Task C — Continuous examples: Which panels are continuous as shown on their intervals? Explain briefly why. Suggested table (copy and fill): Panel Continuous? Discontinuity points Type(s) One-sentence reason 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Extension: For any discontinuity you labeled removable, propose a value for \\(f(a)\\) that would make the function continuous at that point, and justify it. Notes: Summary: A function is continuous at \\(x=a\\) if: 1. \\(f(a)\\) exists, 2. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x)\\) exists, and 3. \\(\\lim_{x\\to a} f(x) = f(a)\\). 8.13 Smoothness: When Is a Function “Nice Enough” to Differentiate? Continuity alone is not enough for differentiability. A function can be continuous but still have sharp corners, cusps, or vertical tangents where the slope suddenly changes or becomes infinite. To take a derivative, the function must also be smooth — meaning its slope changes gradually. 8.13.1 What “Smoothness” Means A function \\(f(x)\\) is smooth at a point \\(x = a\\) if: It is continuous at \\(a\\). Its derivative exists and is finite at \\(a\\). The slope changes continuously (no sudden jumps or sharp turns). Prompt 5: What visual features in a graph help you decide whether a function is “smooth”? List or sketch examples of what fails to be smooth. Notes: 8.13.2 How to Test for Smoothness To check whether a function is smooth at \\(x = a\\): Confirm continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → The graph is unbroken at \\(a\\). Check the slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If both limits exist, are finite, and equal each other, the function is smooth at that point. Look for visual cues: A corner or cusp means slopes differ → not smooth. A vertical tangent means infinite slope → not smooth. A continuous curve with gentle slope change → smooth. Prompt 6: Identify which of the following functions are smooth at \\(x=0\\): Explain your reasoning. Notes: 8.13.3 Why Smoothness Matters Smoothness tells us that the system changes gradually, without abrupt shifts. In environmental modeling, this matters because: Temperature, population, or nutrient levels that change smoothly can be modeled with differential equations. Processes with jumps or discontinuities (like dam releases or landslides) require piecewise or non-differentiable models. 8.13.4 Examples Function Smooth? Why \\(f(x) = x^2\\) ✅ Yes Continuous and derivative exists everywhere \\(f(x) = |x|\\) ❌ No Corner at \\(x=0\\) — left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x}\\) ❌ No Vertical tangent at \\(x=0\\) (infinite slope) \\(f(x) = x\\sin(1/x)\\) (define \\(f(0)=0\\)) ❌ No Oscillating slope near \\(x=0\\) \\(f(x) = e^{-x^2}\\) ✅ Yes Infinitely smooth everywhere 8.14 Testing for Differentiability To test whether \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(x=a\\): Check definition: Make sure \\(f(a)\\) exists. → If not, derivative automatically fails. Check continuity: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = f(a) \\] → If there’s a jump or hole, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) cannot exist. Compare slopes from both sides: \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0^-}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{h \\to 0^+}\\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h} \\] → If they’re equal and finite, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) exists. → If they differ or blow up, \\(f&#39;(a)\\) does not exist. Key relationship: If \\(f\\) is differentiable at \\(a\\), then \\(f\\) is continuous at \\(a\\). However, the converse is not always true — \\(\\text{continuous} \\not\\Rightarrow \\text{differentiable}.\\) Prompt 7: Sketch or describe a function that is continuous but not differentiable. What feature prevents the derivative from existing? Notes: 8.15 Common Ways Differentiability Fails Type of Failure Description Example Discontinuity Jump or hole at the point Step in dam outlet temperature Corner or cusp Left and right slopes differ \\(f(x) = |x|\\) at \\(x=0\\) Vertical tangent Slope tends to \\(\\pm\\infty\\) \\(f(x) = (x)^{1/3}\\) at \\(x=0\\) Oscillating slope No single limiting slope \\(f(x) = x \\sin(1/x)\\) at \\(x=0\\) Checking Differentiability at \\(x=0\\) In each panel below, decide whether the function is differentiable at \\(x=0\\). Use the following criteria to test: 1. Is the function defined at \\(x=0\\)? 2. Is the function continuous at \\(x=0\\)? 3. Do the left-hand and right-hand slopes (derivatives) agree and are they finite? Panel Function Defined at \\(x=0\\)? Continuous at \\(x=0\\)? Left &amp; Right Slopes Equal &amp; Finite? Differentiable? 1 \\(f(x)=e^{-x^2}\\) 2 \\(f(x)=\\sqrt{|x|}\\) 3 \\(f(x)=x+|x|\\) 4 \\(f(x)=\\sin(x^2)\\) 8.16 Environmental Examples Scenario What’s Happening Differentiability Outcome Dam outlet temperature step Sudden jump between upstream and downstream water Derivative does not exist (discontinuous) Piecewise linear rating curve Continuous but with a sharp corner Derivative does not exist at the corner Sharp flood peak Slope becomes extremely steep Derivative may tend to \\(\\infty\\), so does not exist Smooth glacier retreat curve Continuous and smooth change in slope Differentiable 8.17 Activity: From Function to Derivative Graphs In each question below, you are shown a graph of a function \\(f(x)\\). On the blank axes provided, sketch the derivative \\(f&#39;(x)\\). Focus on identifying: where the slope is positive, negative, or zero, relative steepness (large vs. small magnitude), points of non-differentiability or smooth transitions. Recipe of Plotting Derivatives What are we actually plotting? What are the key steps? What are the checks? More Limit Definition Practice Given the quadratic equation: \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + x\\). Find the derivative function using the limit definition of the derivative What is the derivative at x=0, \\(f&#39;x(0)\\)? What does the mean graphically? Can you find the equation for the tangent line at x=0? These equations might help with thinking about the equation of the tangent. \\[ y - f(a) = f&#39;(a)\\,(x - a) \\] \\[ y = mx+b \\] Testing a Limit Consider the function: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1} \\] Find the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x \\to 2\\). \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 2} \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1} \\] Find the limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x \\to 1\\). \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 + 1}{x - 1} \\] Is this function differentiable everywhere?
