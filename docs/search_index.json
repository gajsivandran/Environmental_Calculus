Welcome to Calculus for Environmental Science.  This book is your companion for exploring the natural world through the lens of calculus—especially the powerful ideas of change and accumulation. You’ll find that calculus is not just about symbols on a page—it’s about asking meaningful questions, interpreting patterns, and making sense of complex environmental systems. And along the way, you’ll see that you are absolutely capable of mastering these ideas. 1.1 Why This Book? Most calculus textbooks lean heavily on physics examples—motion, velocity, and acceleration—because calculus was originally developed to solve physics problems. Those examples are powerful, and we’ll use them from time to time because they give us an intuitive “feel” for how change works. But today, calculus is a tool used across many disciplines: biology, ecology, environmental science, economics, engineering, and beyond. In this book, we’ll focus on examples that resonate with your studies and your interests as an environmental scientist. Environmental scientists face some of the most urgent and complex challenges of our time—climate change, biodiversity loss, resource management, and pollution. Calculus gives us tools to: Predict how systems evolve over time Estimate impacts and risks Model natural and human systems with differential equations Analyze rates of change and long-term accumulation Throughout this book, you’ll work with real environmental data, use visual and conceptual approaches, and practice skills that matter for sustainability. Our goal is not just to “get through calculus,” but to see how these mathematical ideas open doors for discovery and problem-solving in the real world. 1.2 What Is Calculus? At its heart, calculus is the mathematics of change and accumulation. These two ideas are everywhere in science: The rate of CO₂ increase in the atmosphere is a derivative. The total added CO₂ over a year is an integral. Traditionally, calculus is first introduced through physics examples like velocity (rate of change of position) and acceleration (rate of change of velocity). These are helpful because most of us can feel what it means to move faster or slower. We’ll use those examples when they make ideas clearer. But throughout this book, our main goal is to connect calculus directly to the environment you are studying. You’ll see derivatives and integrals applied to population growth, forest carbon storage, water flow in rivers, and other natural systems. We’ll build your understanding of these concepts step by step, supported by graphs, data, and hands-on examples. And if it’s been a while since your last math class, that’s completely okay—you’ll find plenty of support here. We’ll meet you where you are and grow your skills together. Change is Everywhere In a small group, discuss where change could be happening in this image? 1.3 How This Book Works Each chapter is designed to support you as a learner. You’ll find: Clear explanations of key concepts Environmental examples to connect math with meaning Practice problems to strengthen your skills Reflection prompts to help you think about what you’re learning 1.4 Success in This Class First and foremost, know this: we believe in your ability to learn and grow. You bring unique strengths and perspectives, and your effort matters here. Mistakes are not a setback—they are the very heart of learning. When you get something wrong, you uncover where your thinking needs refinement, and that creates the space for real growth. Struggle is not a sign you don’t belong; it’s proof that your brain is stretching and building new connections. Just like in science, learning calculus is about iteration—trying, testing, revising, and improving. That process is what makes your understanding deeper and more durable. Assessments in this class are snapshots of your thinking at a particular moment in time. They are not final judgments about your intelligence, your worth, or your potential. You will have chances to revisit concepts, refine your understanding, and demonstrate what you’ve learned. Growth comes from re-engaging with the material, not from perfection on the first try. So give yourself permission to be imperfect. Keep engaging, reflecting, and asking questions. We’ll be here to support you every step of the way. 1.5 Looking Ahead By the end of this course, you will be able to: Apply calculus concepts to natural systems Analyze environmental data with confidence Interpret and communicate your results to others But even more important than any specific skill, you’ll leave this course with a stronger belief in your ability to learn mathematics. Calculus is not just a hurdle to clear—it’s a tool that expands how you see and understand the world. Our hope is that by connecting it to the environment you care about, you’ll discover both its usefulness and its beauty. Most importantly, you’ll leave with the confidence to keep growing—using mathematics as a tool to explore, protect, and better understand the natural world around you. 1.6 ⚠️ A Big Disclaimer ⚠️ I started writing this textbook to create a calculus resource that speaks directly to your interests as environmental scientists. My goal is to make calculus feel relevant, supportive, and connected to the systems you care about. That said, this is very much a work in progress. This draft will have typos, rough edges, and the occasional mistake. But here’s the good news: it’s also free.  If you come across an error—big or small—please let me know so I can fix it for you and for future students. Your feedback is not just welcome, it’s essential to making this a better resource. Thanks for your patience, your sharp eyes, and your willingness to learn from (and with) an evolving text. Together, we’ll keep improving it.

Many of these resources give you the illusion of understanding - but the reality is quite different. 2.7.3 Late Assessment / Missed Assessment Policy This is a firm policy to make sure I am being fair to all of you. Grace period: Homeworks will be accepted 48 hrs after their due date with no penalty. Homeworks not turned in after 48 hrs will receive a grade of zero. Missed Tests: If you miss a test, you will need to use one of your ‘re-takes’ during finals weeks to do it. However, if you have a legitimate reason, I will work with you to reschedule the test earlier so you can save your re-take. Missed Class Preparation/Participation: From time to time we miss class for several reasons (studying for another test that day, field work, illness, etc). There will be no opportunity to submit preparation and participation activities if they are missed. The purpose of these activities are to reinforce concepts in the moment – and have little value out the context of the material being covered that day. To accommodate for this, 5% of the total preparation and participation assessments will be dropped. There will also be additional extra-credit opportunities throughout the term. Exceptional Circumstances: You must contact me 48 hours before the actual due date (not after the 48hr grace period) of a graded assignment to give me advanced notice, or within 12 hours after the work is due in the case of an emergency. If you fail to do this, you will receive zero credit for the missed assignment. Class Discussion What do we consider exceptional circumstances? 2.7.4 Test Retakes Policy There is no Final in this class – BUT – I will use the finals timeslot for the retakes. So don’t plan an early break if you think you might be doing a retake. If you miss a test during the term for a valid reason (health, emergency etc) and inform me in a timely manner, I’ll schedule a time during office hours for you to take the test. This flexibility is only good for a couple of days as I want to get the graded tests back to the rest of the class. If you miss a test for another reason (slept in, went to a wedding etc) you can always use one of your retakes – that’s what they are for. Reasons to retake Missed a test Want to try for a better grade Love calc so much you want to do more problems You can retake upto 2 tests. Your best score counts – so no risk 2.7.5 Office Hours Please select ALL times that could work. I will always try to hang around for 30mins or so after class to answer any questions. Office hours will be posted on Canvas as soon as they are set. 2.7.6 Class notes All notes that I take in class are available on the onenote notebook link on Canvas All lectures will be recorded - these will also be made available on Canvas From time to time the technology will fail us. Remember these are being provided as a bonus. There is no substitute for attending class and taking your own notes. 2.8 Questions? Class discussion Ask me anything - whats on your mind - need clarification on any of the things we’ve talked about? 2.9 Paper Places Paper Plane Activity We are going to make paper planes and then see how well they fly. We are going to break into 4 groups: Group 1: Instructions not included – I know how to make a paper plane already Group 2: Notes - Watch the video multiple times, pausing and taking notes – I’m confident I can make a good plane Group 3: Team – Work together and make 1 TEAM plane. Group 4: Solo first + then team up - Make your own plane, then make a team plane Discussion Why did we make paper planes in calc?

Track units through computations and check results for reasonableness. Build and evaluate a simple model for an environmental variable as a function of time and elevation. It may have been a while since you last used some of your pre-calculus knowledge. Don’t worry if certain topics feel unfamiliar—we’ll walk through each concept with context and practice. This chapter is designed to help you review and refresh the foundational math skills that will support your success in this course. Think of it as a toolbox: later chapters will point to specific tools you’ll need to solve real problems, and those are the ideal moments to revisit them. Concepts stick best when learned in context—so come back to this chapter anytime you need a quick refresher. 3.2 What You’re Expected to Know To get the most out of this course, you should feel reasonably comfortable with: Working with functions and interpreting graphs Manipulating algebraic equations Rules for exponents and logarithms Understanding and converting units Reading and setting up word problems If these topics feel rusty, that’s perfectly normal. This chapter is here to get you back up to speed—and to remind you that you already have more tools than you might think. 3.3 How to Approach Calculus Problems Understanding calculus isn’t about memorizing steps—it’s about learning to think mathematically so you can interpret real-world change. It’s normal for parts of this to feel unfamiliar at first; progress comes from trying, checking, and revising. In this course, we’ll model environmental systems—temperature, rainfall, population dynamics—and the goal is clarity, not perfection on the first attempt. When you get stuck, start small: sketch the situation, label axes and units, compute one example value, and say out loud what a slope or an area means in context. Treat mistakes as information, not judgment—they show you what to try next. Keep going; you’re building tools you’ll use well beyond this class. Here’s a strategy to help you become a more confident problem solver: 3.3.1 Clarify the Ask What is being asked? Is the question about a rate of change, a maximum/minimum, or an accumulated quantity? What type of function or scenario is involved (linear, quadratic, exponential, etc.)? Always start by identifying what quantities are changing and how they’re related. 3.3.2 List the Givens Write down the given information clearly. Label all variables, units, and known values. If a graph or context is given, sketch or summarize what you see. Clarity in setup is half the solution. 3.3.3 Translate the Math Equations are not just symbols—they are instructions: Each term contributes to the behavior of the function. Operators (+, −, ×, ÷, …) tell you what actions to take. Derivatives tell you how the function is changing. Don’t rush through the algebra. Pause and ask: “What is this term telling me?” 3.3.4 Work Step by Step Instead of aiming straight for the final answer, focus on the process: Write out what you’re doing and why. If you take a derivative, explain what it represents (e.g., “This is the rate of change of population over time.”) Label your steps so they can be traced logically. When taking notes, don’t just copy answers. Write procedures and reasoning—this builds transferable understanding. 3.3.5 Reflect and Interpret Does your answer make sense in context? Are the units correct? Is the magnitude reasonable? What does your result say about the system you’re studying? In environmental science, the interpretation is as important as the calculation. 3.3.6 Growth Mindset You may not see math in every class you take—that’s okay. Our goal here is to build confidence and numerical literacy. Solving math problems is a step-by-step process. Thinking too far ahead can cause confusion. Take it one step at a time—that’s how you make progress. Also, try not to overthink mid-solution. If you tried to narrate every muscle movement while climbing stairs, you might trip. Trust yourself. Don’t second-guess every step—work through to the end. When you reflect, you’ll catch errors and sharpen your thinking. Confidence grows by doing. Keep moving forward—even imperfect progress builds understanding. Athletes know this: when you overanalyze your swing while swinging, performance often gets worse. Much of skilled work is partly automatic. Bringing every detail into the conscious mind can interrupt your flow. Trust your instincts. Don’t be afraid to commit to your approach. Swing through—you’ll learn more by finishing a solution than by freezing in doubt. 3.4 How We Communicate Relationships By thinking of functions as input-output machines and visualizing them on a graph, you’ll be better equipped to interpret and model relationships in environmental systems and beyond. A function represents a relationship between two quantities: an input and an output. The way we represent and communicate this is through: Verbal descriptions Graphical representations like charts Tables of data Formulas that capture the relationship Your Turn In a small group describe how the air temperature has changed in the last 24 hours. Write a statement describing the air temperature Graphically represent your description Create a table that represents your discussion Attempt to write an equation Now discuss the pros and cons of each of the methods. Discuss what you can and can’t do with each description of the temperature and time relationship. Discussion Prompt How does air temperature change with elevation as you hike up a mountain? Can we describe that change with a function? As you move upward through the atmosphere, the temperature typically drops at a fairly predictable rate. This is called the adiabatic lapse rate, which averages around 6.5°C per 1000 meters (or about 1°C per 154 meters). You’ll use this rule to model how the temperature changes from Seattle (sea level) to the summit of Mount Rainier (4392 m). Assume the temperature at sea level in Seattle is 18°C. Let’s use our approach to problem solving: What is the ask? What are we given? Translate the Math &amp; Work step-by-step We can translate this word problem into a table. Use the lapse rate to compute the temperature at the following elevations: Elevation (m) Temperature (°C) 0 (Seattle) 1000 2000 3000 4000 We could visualize this data by plotting these points on a graph Use R or graph paper to create a quick sketch of the temperature vs. elevation relationship. Figure 3.1: Air temperature (°C) as a function of time (hours) Finally we could attempt to write a function Use the pattern in the data to define a linear function that models temperature as a function of elevation. Let: \\(T(h)\\) = temperature at elevation \\(h\\) (in meters) Assume \\(T(0) = 18\\) and use the lapse rate to define the slope \\(T(h) =\\) Reflect and Interpret Does you answer make sense? Does it pass the sniff test? Is that what you observe when you go hiking? What does the slope of your function represent? What temperature do you predict at 4392 meters (Mount Rainier’s summit)? 3.5 Functions and Their Representations In the last activity we wrote a simple function. Now let’s take a step back and make sure we understand what functions mean and how they work. 3.5.1 Understanding What \\(f(x)\\) Means You’ve probably seen the equation of a line written like this: \\[ y = mx + b \\] This is the same as writing: \\[ f(x) = mx + b \\] Both notations describe the same relationship. Here’s what they mean: \\(x\\) is the input (what you plug into the function). \\(f(x)\\) or \\(y\\) is the output (what comes out after applying the function rule). Graphically: The input is usually plotted along the x-axis. The output (\\(y\\) or \\(f(x)\\)) is plotted along the y-axis. So when you see a point like \\((4, 11)\\), it means: Input \\(x = 4\\) produces output \\(f(x) = 11\\). A function is like a black box: you put something in, a rule is applied, and you get something out. For example: \\[ f(x) = 2x + 3 \\] If we input \\(x = 4\\): \\[ f(4) = 2 \\cdot 4 + 3 = 11 \\] So the point \\((4, 11)\\) would appear on the graph. Input: \\(x = 4\\) Rule: multiply by 2, then add 3 Output: \\(f(4) = 11\\) 3.5.2 Functions Don’t Have to Be Named \\(f\\) Functions can be named in ways that make their meaning clearer. For example: \\(T(t)\\) for temperature as a function of time \\(P(n)\\) for population as a function of years The variable also doesn’t always have to be \\(x\\). Choosing names that match the context makes your math easier to read, easier to explain, and easier to connect to the real world. 3.5.2.1 Why Meaningful Function Names Matter Suppose we want to model how land temperature T (in °C) changes with distance d (in km) from the shore. We could write the function in a very generic way: \\[ f(x) = 0.2x + 3 \\] Here, f is the temperature and x is the distance. This works mathematically, but it doesn’t tell us much about what the variables mean. A clearer way is to use variables that match the context: \\[ T(d) = 0.2d + 3 \\] Now the function communicates something immediately: \\(T(d)\\) = land temperature (°C) \\(d\\) = distance from the coast (km) This version is not only valid but more meaningful: “Temperature increases by 0.2°C for every kilometer inland, starting from 3°C at the coast.” By naming functions and variables in ways that reflect the system being studied, we make the math easier to interpret, easier to explain, and easier to apply. 3.5.3 Functions Can Have More Than One Input \\(\\, f(x,y)\\) Many environmental processes depend on more than one variable. For example, the distribution of a terrestrial species might be best described as a function of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), where \\(x\\) is longitude and \\(y\\) is latitude. Thinking further: what would the function look like for the location of a species in three dimensions, such as mapping their position in a water column? How would you write this mathematically? In reality, many environmental systems depend on far more than three variables. When building models, the art is in simplifying: choosing the key variables that matter most for the question at hand. Including every possible factor would be too complex to work with, so we focus on what’s essential. Discussion Prompt In a group discuss the factors that control the growth of a tree. Write a pseudo-equation that takes the form of \\[ \\text{Growth} = f(\\text{Variable 1}, \\text{Variable 2}, \\ldots) \\] How many variables drive the growth of a tree? Activity: Modeling Temperature as a Function of Time and Elevation Learning Goals Understand how to construct and interpret a function of two variables. Apply environmental context to multivariable functions. Visualize how elevation impacts the daily temperature cycle using lapse rate. At sea level, the temperature throughout the day is modeled by: \\(T(t) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) [°C]\\) Temperature decreases with elevation, at a lapse rate of 6.5°C per 1000 meters: \\(L= \\frac{6.5}{1000} = 0.0065 [\\frac{°C}{m}]\\) The temperature as a function of elevation alone (assuming sea level temperature is 10°C): \\(T(h) = 10 - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) So the temperature as a function of both time t and elevation h is: \\(T(t, h) = 10 - 5 \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{12}\\right) - 0.0065 \\cdot h\\) ## time elevation temperature ## 1 6 0 10.00 ## 2 6 500 6.75 ## 3 6 1500 0.25 ## 4 12 0 15.00 ## 5 12 1000 8.50 ## 6 18 2000 -3.00 ## 7 18 5000 -22.50 Reflection: At what time of day is the temperature difference between sea level and 2000 m greatest? What happens to the daily temperature range as elevation increases? Does the timing of the warmest part of the day change with elevation? Stare at this equation T(t, h) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * t / 12) - 0.0065 * h, can you visualize the impact of t? what about h? The equation could have been written as f(x, y) = 10 - 5 * cos(pi * x / 12) - 0.0065 * y, would this be harder to interpret? Figure 3.2: Apply the function to compute temperature 3.6 Graphing and Interpreting Change Understanding the shape of a graph is crucial for interpreting real-world phenomena. Here are key features to notice: Increasing/Decreasing: Is the function going up or down as \\(x\\) increases? Peaks and Valleys: Where are the local maxima and minima? Concavity: Does the curve bend upward (concave up) or downward (concave down)? Let’s look at an example of a quadratic function, which is commonly used to model situations with a single peak or valley. This function is an increasing function for \\(x&lt;2\\) and decreasing for \\(x&gt;2\\). It has a maximum at \\(x=2\\). We can also notice that the concavity of the function is concave down. We can also look at the how the function is changing as we move along the x axis. At \\(x=2\\) the slope of the function is positive and steep. As we approach the maximum, the slope of the function is still positive, but its not increasing as fast. We could say its increasing at a decreasing rate. At the peak, the function is not longer changing. Now as we pass \\(x=2\\) the function is decreasing slowly at first, but faster and faster as \\(x\\) gets further away from the peak. You can think of this as a ball in your hand. You throw it up, initially its moving fast, but as gravity acts on the ball it slows. Then for an instance, the ball hangs in the air - this is where it reaches its peak. Then the ball starts to fall, slowly at first, but it then begins to fall faster and faster. The calculus you will learn in this course will give you the tools needed to quatify these observations. Identify the rates of change at different point and find the maximas and minimas. 3.7 Key Function Types Here are five common functions you’ll encounter: Function Type Form Environmental Example Linear \\(y = mx + b\\) Streamflow increasing over time Quadratic \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\) Pollution dispersal from a point source Exponential \\(y = a \\cdot b^x\\) Invasive species growth Logarithmic \\(y = \\log(x)\\) pH or sound intensity Mini Exercise Match the following environmental situations with function types: 1. Forest biomass grows rapidly, then levels off. 2. A spill’s impact decreases as you move downstream. 3. A steady rise in sea level over time. Discussion Prompt What environmental processes could you model with these functions. See if you can identify some additional real-world examples for each graph. Sketch the rough shapes of these functions and identify some of their key features? 3.8 Units, Rates, and Word Problems Units are a scientist’s best friend. They don’t just tell us what we’re measuring—they also help us check if our answers make sense. In calculus, units play a central role because they give meaning to rates of change (derivatives) and accumulations (integrals). Here are some common examples in environmental science: Atmospheric CO₂ concentration is measured in ppm (parts per million). Rainfall might be reported in mm/hour. Streamflow can be given in m³/s (cubic meters per second). Tree growth might be in cm/year. 3.8.1 Why Units Matter Think of units as guardrails for problem solving: They help you avoid mistakes (e.g., mixing meters with kilometers). They give physical meaning to abstract symbols. They allow you to compare across systems and scales. If your answer has the wrong units, it’s almost certainly the wrong answer. 3.8.1.1 A Famous Example: The Mars Orbiter Mishap  In 1999, NASA lost the Mars Climate Orbiter, a spacecraft that cost $390 million to design, build, and launch—all because of a simple unit conversion error. One engineering team used English units (pound-seconds of force). Another team assumed metric units (Newton-seconds). The mismatch went unnoticed, and the spacecraft’s trajectory was off course. The result: the orbiter entered Mars’ atmosphere at the wrong altitude and was destroyed. This dramatic example shows why scientists and engineers obsess over units. While our classroom mistakes won’t crash a $390 million spacecraft, they can still derail your reasoning. Keeping track of units is one of the simplest—and most powerful—ways to check your work. Activity: Average Rate of Change Suppose atmospheric CO₂ increases from 400 ppm to 420 ppm over 5 years. Calculate the average rate of change Now repeat the procee but this time no numbers, run the same calculation with just the units. What do you end up with? Now tell me the sotry of what your calculation means? Reflection Questions What if we reported the time in months instead of years? How would the rate change? What if the increase had been 400 → 420 ppm in 10 years — what happens to the rate? Does “average rate” mean CO₂ increased by exactly 4 ppm every year? Why or why not? 3.8.2 Key Idea A rate of change always involves comparing how much one quantity changes relative to another. \\[ \\text{Rate} = \\frac{\\text{Change in Output}}{\\text{Change in Input}} \\] If the input is time, the rate tells us “how fast” something changes. If the input is distance, the rate might describe a gradient (e.g., temperature lapse rate with elevation). If the input is volume, the rate might describe a concentration per unit volume. Units don’t just check your work—they tell the story of what the math means. 3.9 Getting Comfortable with Word Problems Environmental word problems are at the heart of applying calculus. They take a real-world situation and ask you to identify the quantities involved, describe how they are changing, and build a model that captures those changes. When you read a word problem, pause and ask yourself: What is changing? (What’s the variable of interest?) How fast is it changing? (Are we talking about a rate or an accumulated total?) What influences that change? (Is it driven by time, distance, elevation, or something else?) 3.9.1 Why Word Problems Matter Anyone can compute a derivative or an integral once the equation is written down. The real challenge—and the real skill—is translating words into math. That’s what lets you use calculus to model glaciers, forests, rivers, or populations. Remember: there is no single “right” way to start. Sketching, making a table, or writing down what you know in words are all valid first steps. 3.9.2 Example Problem A glacier is melting at a rate that increases each year. What mathematical tools would help you model this? Step 1. What’s changing? The glacier’s thickness or volume is decreasing. Step 2. How is it changing? The rate of melt is itself increasing over time. That means the rate is not constant. Step 3. What tools do we need? A derivative describes the melt rate at a given moment. An integral (this is a preview of 292) could estimate the total ice lost over a span of years. Because the rate is changing, an exponential or quadratic function might be a better fit than a linear one. Activity: Rate of change around us What other environmental situations involve a rate that changes over time (not just a constant rate)? Discuss and share back with the class How would you represent this glacier problem with a graph? With a table? If you only had measurements of ice thickness each year, how would you estimate the rate of change? 3.9.3 Key Idea Word problems are really about translation. You’re moving between: Verbal description → “the glacier is melting faster each year” Mathematical model → equations that capture this trend Interpretation → what the math tells us about the glacier and its future The math is the language, but the story is always about the system you’re studying. 3.10 Practice: Interpreting Functions 3.10.1 What Are You Practicing? In this section, you’ll get more comfortable reading, interpreting, and evaluating functions — especially those that model environmental systems. You’ll see functions written in different forms (formulas, graphs, tables), and you’ll practice thinking about what the input and output represent. This is an important foundation for calculus. When we interpret derivatives later on, we’ll always come back to what is this function telling us about the real world? 3.10.2 How to Approach These Problems For any function, try answering these three questions: What are the input(s) and output? What does the function take in, and what does it give back? What do the variables represent? For example, is \\(t\\) time? Is \\(T(t)\\) a temperature? What are the units?

Notes: 4.8.4 Build a Rate From Units Only Practice: You measure rainfall in mm over hours. Form a meaningful rainfall rate using just the units (no numbers). What does that rate tell you physically? Think of situations where that rate would be useful. Notes: 4.8.5 Rate Sense-Check Prompt: You computed a melt rate of a glacier as 3 m/day. Is that reasonable? Why or why not?

Interpret the meaning of a derivative from graphs, data, and equations. Apply derivative notation and connect it to environmental contexts. Solve practice problems and apply derivatives to real-world examples. 5.2 Understanding The Speed Of Change Imagine you’re a marine biologist monitoring the population of a reef-dwelling fish species in a protected area. Over the past five years, the fish population has started to rebound after a ban on commercial fishing. But the key question isn’t just how many fish are there now?—it’s how fast is the population recovering? Or picture a team of conservationists tracking the spread of an invasive plant through a national park. The plant’s total coverage increases each month—but is that rate speeding up, slowing down, or holding steady? These are not just ecological observations. They’re questions about change. And answering them requires calculus. 5.3 Why We Need New Math Tools Environmental systems are dynamic. They change in space and time, often unpredictably. To understand them, we don’t just need to measure things—we need to describe how those things change: How fast is a species’ population growing or shrinking? At what rate is temperature increasing in alpine ecosystems? How steeply is oxygen concentration decreasing with depth in a lake? When does the tide rise the fastest? These are all examples of rates of change, and they are the foundation of the derivative. 5.4 What You’ll Learn in This Chapter In this chapter, you’ll build your intuition for what a derivative represents. We’ll explore: The difference between average and instantaneous change How to interpret a derivative from a graph Real examples where rates of change matter The mathematical notation that lets us describe and work with change You’ll also work with data—like fish populations, temperature profiles, and environmental time series—to see how derivatives emerge from patterns and graphs. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to look at a system and say not just what is happening, but how fast is it happening—and in which direction? That’s the power of the derivative. 5.5 What Is A Derivative? You’ve probably seen derivatives before—even if you didn’t call them that. If you’ve ever looked at how fast something was growing, declining, or shifting in space or time, you’ve already been thinking about derivatives. Table 5.1: Terms Across Disciplines That Represent Derivatives Math…Physics…Data.Context Environmental…Applied.Context Rate of change Growth rate Slope of the tangent line Decay rate Instantaneous rate Reaction rate Velocity Flux Acceleration Turnover rate Gradient Loss rate / Gain rate Marginal change Change per unit time Slope at a point Response rate Rise over run Uptake rate Delta Y / Delta X First difference Mathematically, the derivative describes the instantaneous rate of change—the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a given point. 5.6 Average Rate of Change Discussion Prompt Think about a population of salmon in a river system. Suppose the number of salmon increases steadily over a migration season. How could we describe how fast the population is changing? The average rate of change of a quantity tells us how much that quantity changes per unit of time (or distance, or any other input variable). It’s a way to summarize how something is increasing or decreasing over an interval, even if the actual change isn’t perfectly steady throughout. Mathematically, the average rate of change of a function \\(f(x)\\) between two points \\(x = a\\) and \\(x = b\\) is: \\[ \\text{Average Rate of Change} = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \\] This is the rise over run formula you’ve likely used in algebra. It gives us the slope of the secant line connecting the two points on a graph. 5.6.1 Environmental Example: Ocean Temperature Let’s say ocean surface temperature is modeled by a function \\(T(t)\\), where \\(t\\) is time in months and \\(T(t)\\) is the temperature in degrees Celsius. Suppose: In June (\\(t = 6\\)), the temperature is \\(T(6) = 13^\\circ C\\) In September (\\(t = 9\\)), the temperature is \\(T(9) = 16^\\circ C\\) The average rate of temperature change from June to September is: \\[ \\frac{T(9) - T(6)}{9 - 6} = \\frac{16 - 13}{3} = 1^\\circ C \\text{ per month} \\] Interpretation: On average, the ocean surface temperature increased by 1°C per month during this time. 5.6.2 More Examples from Environmental Science Goal: Practice identifying real-world situations where average rate of change is meaningful. Step 1: Review Examples Together Here are some examples of average rate of change in environmental contexts: Carbon Emissions: Change in CO₂ levels over decades. Glacier Retreat: How much a glacier’s area changes per year. Step 2: Small Group Brainstorm (5 minutes) In groups of 2–3: Come up with two additional examples of average rate of change from your own experiences, interests, or fields of study. Be sure to state: What is changing? (the variable) With respect to what? (time, distance, depth, etc.) What are the units? Step 3: Share and Discuss As a class, compare: Which variables appear most often? Which contexts involve rapid change vs. slow change? Which examples could also benefit from looking at the change over shorter periods? Reflection Prompt (Individual, 2 minutes): Think about your major or area of interest. Write down one rate of change you might realistically measure or model in your field. A Visual View Discussion Questions Describe the Trend What does the plot tell you about how global sea level has changed since 1993? Is the trend linear, exponential, or something else?

What does that suggest about the acceleration of sea level rise? Connect to Derivatives If this were a smooth function \\(S(t)\\) representing sea level at year \\(t\\), what would the derivative \\(S&#39;(t)\\) represent? What would a plot of the average rate of change look like? What would happen if we looked at the average rate of change over shorter and shorter periods? How would this chang the way a plot of the rate of change look like? Reflection Prompt Describe a situation in your area of interest (marine biology, forestry, climate science, etc.) where an average rate of change is used. What does it tell you, and what might it leave out? 5.7 Instantaneous Rate of Change: Zooming In In the last section, you estimated the average rate of sea level rise over several 5-year periods. But what if we want to know how fast sea level was rising at one specific moment—say, in the year 2010? That’s where the instantaneous rate of change comes in. It answers the question: How fast is something changing right now? This is the essence of what we mean by the derivative in calculus. 5.7.1 From Averages to Instants Think back to the graph of sea level rise: The average rate over a time interval is the slope of a secant line connecting two points. The instantaneous rate at a single point is the slope of the tangent line at that point. You can imagine drawing shorter and shorter secant lines—where the two points move closer together. As the interval shrinks, the slope of the secant approaches the slope of the tangent. This limiting process—zooming in on a curve until the “average” becomes the “instant”—is the central idea of the derivative. 5.7.2 Environmental Meaning In sea level terms, the instantaneous rate tells us: How fast sea level is rising at a specific year (e.g., 2010). Whether that rate is speeding up (acceleration) or slowing down. Similar questions appear across environmental science: How fast is a glacier front retreating today? How quickly is a species’ population growing right now compared to 10 years ago? What is the current rate of deforestation in a region? Understanding these instantaneous rates of change allows scientists to: Model dynamic systems more accurately. Make predictions about future change. Take action at the moments when it matters most. 5.7.3 Activity: Environmental Meaning of Instantaneous Change Goal: Connect the mathematical idea of instantaneous rate of change to an animal’s life history — and begin to think about how that rate itself can change. Step 1: Predict Together (2 minutes) Imagine tracking the weight of a bear over its entire lifetime. Sketch or imagine what you think the weight vs. age graph might look like. Where do you think the curve is steepest? Flat? Could it ever slope downward? Step 2: Small Group Brainstorm (5 minutes) In groups of 2–3 discuss 1. What does the instantaneous rate of weight change represent biologically at different stages? 2. Where is the bear gaining weight faster and faster (accelerating)? 3. Where is the bear still gaining weight, but more slowly (decelerating)? 4. Why might wildlife managers care about not only the rate of change, but whether that rate itself is increasing or decreasing? Step 3: Share &amp; Compare (5 minutes) Each group shares one insight. Compare across groups: At which ages would the rate of weight gain likely be accelerating? When would it be slowing down? When might the rate even become negative? Discuss: Why does knowing the rate of change of the rate of change add more insight than the rate alone? Step 4: Individual Reflection (2 minutes) Think of another lifetime pattern in an organism: What is changing across the lifetime? At what stage is growth accelerating? At what stage is growth decelerating? What decisions or actions could this second layer of information support (e.g., timing of reproduction, monitoring health decline, conservation priorities)? 5.8 The Limit Definition of a Derivative In calculus, a limit is a tool we use to understand what happens to a function as we get closer and closer to a specific point—even if we can’t plug in that point directly. Don’t worry if limits feel abstract at first—we’ll build the idea step by step with words, graphs, and formulas. 5.8.1 Intuition Suppose you were camping on the beach next to the Pacific Ocean on the 4th of July. You may not know the exact rate of sea level change on that day, but you could estimate the average rate of change nearby—for example, by comparing the sea level on July 3rd and July 4th. A limit takes this idea even further. Instead of looking at an average over whole days, we imagine shrinking the time interval smaller and smaller—so small that the “average period” is tending toward zero. In that process, we arrive at the instantaneous rate of change: how fast sea level is changing at that exact moment. 5.8.2 Why Do We Need Limits? Environmental systems are often continuous and messy for example air temperature, pollution levels, or population growth. To explore questions such as: How fast is a glacier melting right now? What is the rate of deforestation at the edge of a forest? How quickly is sea level rising at a given year? …we need a mathematical tool that captures behavior as we “zoom in.” That tool is the limit. 5.8.3 Visual Intuition As you zoom in on a curve—say, sea level rise over time—it begins to look straight. The slope of that straight line is the instantaneous rate of change. The limit formalizes this process of zooming in infinitely close. Activity: Zooming in on a Curve Goal: Explore how zooming in around a single point makes any curve begin to look like a straight line. Step 1: Observe the Panels (2 minutes) Look at the 4-panel figure: Panel 1 shows the full curve. Panels 2–4 zoom in closer and closer around a single point. Question: What changes as we zoom in? What stays the same? Step 2: Compare the Curve and the Line (5 minutes) In Panels 2–4 you see both the curve and the tangent line at the chosen point. How do the curve and tangent look different in Panel 2? By Panel 4, what do you notice about how closely the curve and the tangent overlap? Step 3: Make a Prediction (3 minutes) If we zoomed in even further (say, Panel 5, Panel 6…), what would you expect to see? Would you still be able to tell the difference between the curve and the line? Step 4: Generalize the Idea (5 minutes) Discuss in pairs or small groups: Do you think this would only work for this one curve, or for any smooth (continous) curve? What does this suggest about the nature of curves when we zoom in enough? Step 5: Reflection (2 minutes) Write down your own words to complete this sentence: When you zoom in close enough on any smooth curve, it starts to look like a ________. Takeaway: This activity shows that every smooth curve looks linear when you zoom in far enough. That’s why we use tangent lines and derivatives in calculus—to capture the local linear behavior of a curve. 5.8.4 Mathematical Notation A limit is written as: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\] Read aloud: “The limit of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\).” It asks: What value does \\(f(x)\\) get closer and closer to as \\(x\\) gets closer and closer to \\(a\\)? Notice: this may or may not equal \\(f(a)\\) or in other words, we closer to \\(a\\) but never actually get there. 5.8.5 Example: A hole in a function Let’s say we have a function below and are interested at what the value of the function is at \\(x=1\\): \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] At first glance, if we try to plug in \\(x = 1\\), we get: \\[ f(1) = \\frac{1^2 - 1}{1 - 1} = \\frac{0}{0} \\] This is undefined! But we can still ask: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] Factoring the numerator: \\[ \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = \\frac{(x - 1)(x + 1)}{x - 1} \\] As long as \\(x \\ne 1\\), the \\(x - 1\\) cancels out: \\[ f(x) = x + 1 \\] So as \\(x \\to 1\\), \\(f(x) \\to 2\\). Even though \\(f(1)\\) is undefined, the limit exists: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = 2 \\] # Define the function f &lt;- function(x) { (x^2 - 1) / (x - 1) } # Create x values avoiding x = 1 to prevent division by zero x_vals &lt;- seq(0.5, 1.5, length.out = 100) x_vals &lt;- x_vals[x_vals != 1] # Evaluate the function y_vals &lt;- f(x_vals) # Plot the function plot(x_vals, y_vals, type = &quot;l&quot;, lwd = 2, col = &quot;blue&quot;, xlab = &quot;x&quot;, ylab = &quot;f(x)&quot;, main = expression(&quot;Plot of &quot; * f(x) == frac(x^2 - 1, x - 1))) # Add a dashed horizontal line for the limit value abline(h = 2, col = &quot;gray&quot;, lty = 2) # Add the hole at x = 1 points(1, 2, pch = 1, col = &quot;red&quot;, cex = 1.5, lwd = 2) text(1, 2.2, labels = &quot;Hole at x = 1&quot;, pos = 3, cex = 0.8) Graphically we can see the function doesn’t exist at \\(x=1\\), which we depict as an open circle. But we can still ask, what function value do we approach as we get close to 2. 5.8.6 Estimating a limit In some cases it may not be possible to factor like the example above. So how could you get an idea of the limit. Lets introduce the idea of estimating the limit. If we write the limit again adn ask ourselves what is this mathematical statement asking: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\] If is asking, what it the value of the function as x gets closer and closer to \\(1\\). So what if we let \\(x\\) get really really close. Let x= 0.9 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.9^2-1}{0.9-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.19}{-0.1} \\approx 1.9 \\] Notice we are using the approximate symbol (\\(\\approx\\)) to show that we are estimating. What is we get closer still to \\(x=1\\). Let x= 0.99 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.99^2-1}{0.99-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.0199}{-0.01} \\approx 1.99 \\] We seem to be getting closer and close to the the value we expect. Lets get really small now. Let x= 0.999999 \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{0.999999^2-1}{0.999999-1} \\approx \\frac{-0.00000199}{-0.000001} \\approx 1.999999 \\] Note: Be careful when doing this on your calculator, it is easy to forget a digit on the numerator or a denominator, and if you do your answer may be too big or too small. 5.8.7 One-Sided Limits Sometimes, its helpful to examine what is happening as we approach a point fomr both directions directios. In the previous example we apprach from the left (or the negative) side of the point. Left-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) \\] — from values less than \\(a\\) Right-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] — from values greater than \\(a\\) You can think about this as what is the value of the function a little bit to the left and right of the point we are approaching. Extending the example above if we approached from the right \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} \\approx \\frac{1.000001^2-1}{1.000001-1} \\approx \\frac{0.000002000001}{0.000001} \\approx 2.000001 \\] If the left-hand and right-hand limits agree, then the overall limit exists. So in the previous example a limit exists at \\(x=1\\) and that limit is 2. \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] 5.8.8 When Does a Limit Exist? For a limit to exist at a point, the function’s behavior must be predictable and consistent as we approach that point. We say: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) = L \\] only if all three of the following conditions are true: The Left-Hand Limit Exists \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from values less than \\(a\\), the function values must approach a real number. The Right-Hand Limit Exists \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] As \\(x\\) approaches \\(a\\) from values greater than \\(a\\), the function values must also approach a real number. The Left- and Right-Hand Limits Are Equal \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to a^+} f(x) \\] If the two one-sided limits are not equal, the two-sided limit does not exist. 5.8.9 When a Limit Does Not Exist A limit fails to exist if any of the following happen: Type of Breakdown What Happens Jump discontinuity Left and right limits are different Infinite discontinuity One or both sides approach \\(\\infty\\) or \\(-\\infty\\) Oscillating behavior Function fluctuates wildly near the point (e.g., \\(\\sin(1/x)\\)) 5.8.10 Environmental Example: Stream Temperature at a Dam Outlet Suppose a river’s temperature is modeled as a piecewise function: \\[ T(x) = \\begin{cases} 15, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\quad \\text{(upstream)} \\\\\\\\ 10, &amp; x &gt; 0 \\quad \\text{(downstream near a cold water dam release)} \\end{cases} \\] At \\(x = 0\\), the left-hand and right-hand limits do not match, so: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to 0} T(x) \\quad \\text{does not exist} \\] This kind of jump is common in natural or engineered boundaries and reminds us that limits describe approaching behavior, not necessarily the value at a point. 5.8.11 Plot the Discontinuity plot(NULL, xlim = c(-5, 5), ylim = c(8, 17), xlab = &quot;Distance from dam (km)&quot;, ylab = &quot;Temperature (°C)&quot;, main = &quot;Temperature Discontinuity at Dam Outlet&quot;) # Upstream: constant 15°C for x &lt; 0 segments(-5, 15, 0, 15, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;, lwd = 2) # Downstream: constant 10°C for x &gt; 0 segments(0, 10, 5, 10, col = &quot;forestgreen&quot;, lwd = 2) # Open circles at x = 0 points(0, 15, pch = 1, cex = 1.5, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;) points(0, 10, pch = 1, cex = 1.5, col = &quot;forestgreen&quot;) text(-2.5, 15.5, &quot;Upstream (15°C)&quot;, col = &quot;steelblue&quot;) text(2.5, 9.5, &quot;Downstream (10°C)&quot;, col = &quot;forestgreen&quot;) abline(v = 0, col = &quot;gray70&quot;, lty = 2) 5.9 From Average to Instantaneous: The Role of Limits In environmental science, we often need to understand how fast something is changing right now — not just on average. Whether it’s the rate at which a glacier melts or how quickly CO₂ levels rise, we need a precise way to describe instantaneous change. But how do we go from a change over time (average) to a momentary change (instantaneous)? 5.9.1 Recap: Average Rate of Change We define the average rate of change of a function \\(f(t)\\) between two times \\(t=a\\) and \\(t=b\\) as: \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] This tells us how much the function changes over the interval — for example, how much sea level rose on average over a 10-year window. To find the function values in the numerator, we would subsitute \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) into the original function \\(f(t)\\). The denominator is just the difference in time between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), or the interval we are calculating this average. Another form of this equation (which will be useful in a few sections) is achieved by doing a substitution. If we let \\(h\\) be the interval of interest. Then \\(h=b-a\\) The average equation now becomes: \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{h} \\] We can go a little further and rearrange the expression for \\(h\\) in terms of \\(b\\) \\[ h=b-a \\\\ b=a+h \\] Substituting this expression for \\(b\\) into the average equaiton gives us \\[ Ave = \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] So lets think about this in words. The numerator is the difference in the function value at \\(a\\) and some value at \\(a+h\\). The denominator now just becomes the interval over which we are taking the average. We’ll get some practice with this form a little later. 5.9.2 Instantaneous Rate of Change But what if we want to know the rate of change at a single moment, like exactly at year 2020? We can’t plug \\(h = 0\\) directly into the formula — we’d be dividing by zero. Instead, we take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ f&#39;(t) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(t)}{h} \\] This is the limit definition of a derivative — and it gives us the instantaneous rate of change \\(f&#39;\\) at time \\(a\\). 5.9.3 Environmental Interpretation Let’s say we have a function \\(S(t)\\) that gives sea level (in mm) at year \\(t\\). The instantaneous rate of sea level rise at \\(t = 2020\\) is: \\[ S&#39;(2020) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{S(2020 + h) - S(2020)}{h} \\] This tells us how quickly sea level is rising at that exact year, in mm/year. 5.9.4 Visualizing the Transition Activity: From Average Change to Instantaneous Change Goal: Connect the graph of lake level changes with the equations for average rate of change (secant slope) and instantaneous rate of change (derivative). Step 1: Observe the Graphs (2 minutes) Look at the three panels: Left: secant line from 2005 to 2015 Middle: secant line from 2005 to 2010 Right: secant line from 2005 to 2006 Questions: How does the red secant line change as the interval gets smaller? How does it compare to the green tangent line? Step 2: Recall the Equations (3 minutes) Average rate of change (secant): \\[ \\frac{f(a+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Instantaneous rate of change (derivative): \\[ \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Step 3: Explain in Your Own Words (5 minutes) With a partner, explain: What does the average rate of change represent for the lake level between 2005 and 2015? Between 2005 and 2006? How does shrinking the interval \\(h\\) change the meaning of the secant line? Why does the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\) give us the tangent line? Step 4: Environmental Meaning (5 minutes) In the context of lake levels: What does the tangent slope at 2005 represent in words? Why might scientists care about the instantaneous rate instead of just average changes over long intervals? Step 5: Reflection (2 minutes) Complete the sentence in your notes: As \\(h\\) gets smaller, the secant slope \\(\\frac{f(x_0+h)-f(x_0)}{h}\\) gets closer to the tangent slope. In my own words, this means… 5.10 Finding the Derivative Using the Limit Definition of a Derivative In this section we will use the limit definition of a derivative to find a function that represents the derivative. Let’s consider the following function: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] Note the function here is a function in \\(x\\) Now let’s consider the function at some point on the function where \\(x=a\\). We can re-write the limit definition of a derivative as: \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Let’s now interpret what the math is telling us: \\(f&#39;(a)\\) is the derivative of the function \\(f\\) at \\(x=a\\) \\(\\lim_{h \\to 0}\\) tells us we are going to approach \\(x=a\\) but not quite get there \\(f(a+h)\\) is the function evaluation at \\(x=a+h\\) \\(f(a)\\) is the function evaluated at \\(x=a\\) Now considering these definitions, we can see that if \\(h\\) was greater than zero, this expression would be the average of the function between \\(x=a\\) and \\(x=a+h\\). However, the limit operator allows h to approach zero. If were to simply plug \\(h=0\\) into the above expression we would get \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\frac{f(a + 0) - f(a)}{0} = \\frac{0}{0} \\] If you divide anything by zero, your calculator will give you an undefined error. This is why we use the limit, it gets us really really close to zero without actually getting there. Let’s consider the derivative of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) and try to find the derivative at \\(x=2\\). We are in search of the derative at \\(x=2\\), this is the same as the slope of the tangent line at same point. The graph above has sketched in the tangent line. We can graphically calculate the slope of the line by looking at the rise over the run. From \\(x=1\\) to \\(x=2\\) we have a run of 1 and a rise of 4. Therefore the slope would be \\(\\frac{4}{1}=4\\). This is the derivative of this function at \\(x=2\\). We don’t always have the ability to solve derivatives graphically, so now that we know the answer we are looking for lets see if we can use the limit definition to get to the same place. \\[ f&#39;(a)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Let’s practice letting the mathematical expression tell us what to do. We know we are interested at the point \\(x=2\\) so therefore \\(a=2\\). Substituting \\(a=2\\) into the limit definition of a derivative gives us: \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(2 + h) - f(2)}{h} \\] Let’s now look at the numerator the right hand side. It tells us we are looking for the difference between the function evaulated at \\(f(2+h)\\) and \\(f(2)\\). So lets find those expressions. We were given the function as \\(f(x)=x^2\\). So to find \\(f(2+h)\\) and \\(f(2)\\) we subsitute the \\(x\\) in the original function with the points we are interested in. \\(f(2)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(2)= (2)^2=4 \\] \\(f(2+h)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(2+h)= (2+h)^2\\\\ f(2+h)= (2+h)(2+h) = h^2+4h+4 \\] Its best to expand the result so that we can manipulate the function a little easier down the road. We don’t want to substitute anything in for \\(h\\) just yet, we’ll be using the limit operator to deal with the \\(h\\) in a few steps. So now lets combine these two results to get an expression for the numerator: \\[ f(2+h)-f(2)\\\\ (h^2+4h+4)-(4)\\\\ h^2+4h \\] Lets put this back into our limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(2 + h) - f(2)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h} \\] We could now try to see what happens if we push \\(h\\) to its limit \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{(0)^2+4(0)}{0}=\\frac{0}{0} \\] This is undefined, and didn’t solve our original issue of dividing by zero. But if we look at the last expression we created, we can see that \\(h\\) could be factored out of the numerator. This would then allow the \\(h\\) in the denominator to be cancelled out. \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+4h}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(h+4)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+4)\\\\ \\] Now if we take the limit as \\(h\\) approaches zero, think of if as a extremely small number. Then we would have \\(4\\) plus a very very small number. Which is effectively \\(4\\). \\[ f&#39;(2)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+4)=0+4=4 \\] We have now found the derivative of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) at \\(x=2\\). Or in other words the instantaneous rate of change at that point. 5.10.1 What if we wanted to find the derivative at any point? If the function is smooth and continuous (more on what this means later). Then rather than solving the definition of a function in terms of \\(a\\) we can solve it with respect to any \\(x\\). \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Let’s redo the example but this time instead of \\(a=2\\) let \\(a=x\\). Let’s now look at the numerator the right hand side. It tells us we are looking for the difference between the function evaluated at \\(f(x+h)\\) and \\(f(x)\\). So lets find those expressions. We were given the function as \\(f(x)=x^2\\). So to find \\(f(x+h)\\) and \\(f(x)\\) we subsitute the \\(x\\) in the original function with the points we are interested in. \\(f(x)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(x)= (x)^2=x^2 \\] \\(f(x+h)\\) becomes: \\[ f(x)=x^2\\\\ f(x+h)= (x+h)^2\\\\ f(x+h)= (x+h)(x+h) = x^2+2xh+h^2 \\] Again, we don’t want to substitute anything in for \\(h\\) just yet. So now lets combine these two results to get an expression for the numerator: \\[ f(x+h)-f(x)\\\\ (x^2+2xh+h^2)-(x^2)\\\\ h^2+2xh \\] Lets put this back into our limit definition of a derivative: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+2xh}{h} \\] Once again we can see that \\(h\\) could be factored out of the numerator. This would then allow the \\(h\\) in the denominator to be cancelled out. \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h^2+2xh}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{h(h+2x)}{h}\\\\ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+2x)\\\\ \\] Now if we take the limit as \\(h\\) approaches zero: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\lim_{h \\to 0} (h+2x)=0+2x=2x\\\\ f&#39;(x)=2x \\] We have now found the derivative function of the function \\(f(x)=x^2\\) for all \\(x\\). Or in other words the instantaneous rate of change at any point. Note we can see if we look at \\(x=2\\), the derivative becomes 4 - which was what we got when we looked at the derivative at a point. Lets check it graphically. Using the above function, we could find the derivative of \\(f(x)=x^2\\) at \\(x=1\\). \\[ f&#39;(x)=2x\\\\ f&#39;(1)=2(1)=2 \\] Looking at the graph of the tangent at \\(x=1\\) we can calculate the slope. Using rise over run be can see that the tangent goes from \\((1,1)\\) to \\((3,5)\\), this is a rise of \\(4\\) over a run of \\(2\\). Rise over run gives us a slope of \\(2\\). 5.11 Practice: Conceptual Warm-Up These questions will help you review and reinforce key ideas before we dive into graphs and calculations. You’ve already seen how derivatives appear across different fields, now let’s make sure you understand what they mean. 5.11.1 Match the Concept to the Context Match each mathematical concept with its real-world environmental interpretation: Math Concept Environmental Interpretation A.

Rate of nitrogen runoff into a river Average fish population over a decade Change in ice thickness per day Speed of wind at a given moment 5.11.10 Reflect Describe a situation in your field (e.g., climate, marine, ecological, or urban systems) where understanding how fast something is changing could be important. What would the derivative tell you, and how might that help in decision making? 5.12 Practice: Interpreting Derivatives from Graphs In this section, you’ll strengthen your visual intuition about what derivatives represent. We’ll explore how to read increasing/decreasing behavior, slope, and curvature from graphs—and what those features tell us about the underlying system. 5.12.1 Identify Slope Behavior from a Graph Below is a sketch of a function representing streamflow over time. Without doing any calculations, answer the following: During which intervals is the function increasing? During which intervals is it decreasing? Where is the slope of the tangent line steepest? Where does the slope of the tangent line appear to be zero? 5.12.2 Estimate the Sign of the Derivative For each marked point on the graph below, estimate whether the derivative is: Positive Negative Zero Complete the table: Point Behavior of Function Estimated Sign of Derivative A B C D 5.12.3 Sketch the Tangent Line Sketch 3 tangent lines at a point: Where the function is increasing slowly Where the function is increasing rapidly Where the function reaches a minimum Then, graphically estimate the slope of those tangent lines.

Based on the graph: When is the tide rising most rapidly? When is the tide falling? Identify all the points where the rate of change of tide height is zero, H’(t) = 0. What do these features represent? 5.12.7 Increasing or Decreasing? Consider a graph representing forest biomass over time. Over the 50 years, identify periods of positive, zero and negative slope. In your own words, describe the rate of change through the 50 years Initially: Around yr 25: Towards the end: Identify where the biomass function is concave up and concave down. Try and identify the ‘point of inflection’ - this is the point where the concavity changes from up to down (or down to up). In your own words, describe what these concavity means in relation to the derivative. If the graph started to curve downward: What might that tell us about derivative. 5.12.8 Slope Sketch Challenge Sketch a curve that satisfies all of the following: Starts off increasing at \\(x=0\\) Reaches a peak at \\(x =3\\) and then decreases after that Has a steepest decrease aorund \\(x=4\\) and then decreases at a slower rate Label one point where the derivative is positive, one where it is zero, and one where it is negative. 5.12.9 Which Graph Matches the Story? Read the scenario below and choose which of the following graphs (A, B, or C) best fits the story. A new invasive plant begins to spread. At first, growth is slow. Then it accelerates rapidly, and finally levels off as it reaches the edges of the available habitat. Graph A: Linear growth Graph B: S-curve (logistic growth) Graph C: Sharp increase followed by sudden drop Why did you choose your answer? What does the slope (derivative) of your choice look like over time? 5.13 Practice: Average Rate of Change In this section, you’ll explore the idea of the average rate of change a way of measuring how much a quantity changes per unit of time (or other input) over a chosen interval. Mathematically, it’s the slope of a secant line connecting two points on a graph. You’ll practice working with the formula, sketching diagrams, and interpreting units. You’ll also apply the concept in different contexts. Along the way, you’ll compare positive, negative, and zero rates of change, and connect these slopes to meaningful environmental stories. By the end, you should be able to move confidently between the equation, the graph, and the real-world context to explain what an average rate of change tells us—and what it doesn’t. 5.13.1 Concept Check: Formula Write the formula for the average rate of change of a function \\(f(x)\\) from \\(x = a\\) to \\(x = b\\). Sketch a diagram, with a random function, and label the following: On the x-axis label \\(x=a, x=b\\) On the y-axis label \\(f(a), f(b)\\) On the function, mark the points at \\((a,f(a)) , (b,f(b))\\) Sketch the secant line Now explain in your own words what each part of the average rate of change formula means. 5.13.2 Units Matter If \\(f(t)\\) represents lake temperature in degrees Celsius and \\(t\\) is measured in months, what are the units of the average rate of change? Why are units important when interpreting your result? 5.13.3 From a Table of Data The table below shows the carbon content of soil over time. Year Carbon (kg/m²) 2000 4.1 2005 4.8 2010 5.0 Compute the average rate of change from: 2000 to 2005 2005 to 2010 2000 to 2010 Write a statement interpret your result in context, including units. What conclusions can you make? Note: Given the data is in periods of 5 years, no conclusions of what is happening at timescales below 5 years is possible. 5.13.4 Graph Interpretation The graph below shows the area of a glacier over time. Choose two points on the graph, estimate their coordinates, and calculate the average rate of change. How can you visually determine if the glacier is shrinking at a constant, accelerating or decelerating rate? 5.13.5 Secant Line Visualization The graph below shows the glacier function with a secant line drawn between \\(t = 5\\) and \\(t = 15\\). Estimate the slope of the secant line and interpret what it means in the context of glacier loss (with units). 5.13.6 Environmental Model Application Suppose sea level in a coastal region is modeled by: \\[ S(t) = 3.2t + 45 \\] where \\(S(t)\\) is in millimeters and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Compute the average rate of change of \\(S(t)\\) from 2010 to 2020. State the units of your answer. Interpret the result in the context of sea level trends. 5.13.7 Positive vs. Negative vs. Zero Consider the average rate of change of an environmental quantity of your choice over a specified interval. Give one example where the average rate of change would be positive (increasing). Give one example where it would be negative (decreasing). Give one example where it would be approximately zero (stable). For each example, write 1–2 sentences explaining the context and why the sign makes sense. 5.13.8 Comparing Intervals Let \\(f(t) = 100 + 2t - 0.1t^2\\) represent the area covered by an invasive weed in (km\\(^2\\)) and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Compute the average rate of change of \\(f\\) from \\(t = 0\\) to \\(t = 5\\). Compute the average rate of change of \\(f\\) from \\(t = 15\\) to \\(t = 20\\). Compare the magnitudes of the two rates. Compare the signs of the two rates Explain what this comparison suggests about how the invasive weed’s rate changes over time. Bonus: Just by looking at the three terms in \\(f(t)\\), can you explain what is happening. Hint: as your self what happens to each of the terms when t = 0, t is small, t is big 5.13.9 Storytelling with Data You are monitoring algae growth in a pond. Between week 2 and week 6, the average rate of change in biomass is \\(0.5 \\,\\text{g}/\\text{m}^2/\\text{week}\\). Rewrite this statement in plain language for a non-technical audience. Briefly describe what additional information (e.g., baseline levels, thresholds, seasonality) would help interpret whether this rate is concerning. Suggest one management action that might follow from this information. 5.13.10 Reverse Engineering A study reports that the average rate of change of nitrogen concentration in a stream was \\(-0.2 \\,\\text{mg}/\\text{L}/\\text{year}\\) from 2010 to 2020. Explain the meaning of the negative sign in this context. Provide one plausible environmental reason for this trend List one potential confounding factor that could make this average misleading. State one follow-up analysis you would perform to confirm the trend. 5.14 Practice: Instantaneous Rate of Change 5.14.1 Introduction In this section, you’ll focus on the instantaneous rate of change, how fast something is changing at one specific moment in time. Unlike the average rate, which looks at overall change across an interval, the instantaneous rate captures the “right now” slope of a tangent line. You’ll practice distinguishing average vs. instantaneous change, sketching tangent lines on curves, and estimating slopes from tables, graphs, and formulas. You’ll also connect these ideas to environmental contexts.By the end, you’ll be able to interpret tangent slopes mathematically and ecologically, explain when instantaneous rates matter more than averages, and use them to make predictions about how environmental systems evolve in real time. 5.14.2 Concept Check: Instantaneous vs. Average In your own words, explain the difference between average rate of change and instantaneous rate of change. Give an environmental example where the two would be very different. 5.14.3 Tangent Line Meaning The slope of the tangent line at a point on a graph represents the instantaneous rate of change. Draw a sketch of a random curve and label your axis with some environmental quantity. Pick a point on your sketch and draw a tangent line. Describe in words what the slope means in the context of an environmental scenario you created. 5.14.4 Zooming In on a Graph Below is a plot of stream temperature over time. Approximate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 4\\) by drawing a tangent line. Estimate the slope of that tangent line. State what your result means about the rate of temperature change at that moment. 5.14.5 Matching Slopes to Graphs Five curves are shown below. Each point \\(P\\) has a different slope. Match each graph to the correct slope value from the list: \\(-1.0\\), \\(4.0\\), \\(-4.0\\), \\(0.5\\), \\(-0.4\\). Explain your reasoning for each match. 5.14.6 Instantaneous Rate from a Formula Given: \\[ f(t) = 50 - 4t + 0.2t^2 \\] where \\(t\\) is in years and \\(f(t)\\) is the depth of a wetland pool (cm). In this problem, do not try to calculate the instananous rate of change, but rather lets estimate it from the definition of the derivative: \\[ f&#39;(t) =\\lim_{h \\to 0}\\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} \\] Use a small value of \\(h\\), \\(h = 0.1\\), to estimate \\(f&#39;(5)\\). The limit definition equation becomes \\[ f&#39;(t) \\approx \\frac{f(t+h) - f(t)}{h} \\] Interpret the result in context, including units. Try again using \\(h = 0.001\\), what do you notice about your estimate? Is it approaching a value? 5.14.7 Biological Growth Example A fish population is modeled by: \\[ P(t) = 500 \\cdot e^{0.08t} \\] where \\(t\\) is in months and \\(P(t)\\) is the number of individuals. Estimate \\(P&#39;(6)\\) using the limit definition of a derivative. Interpret the meaning of your answer in terms of fish population growth. 5.14.8 Zero Instantaneous Rate Give one real-world environmental example where the instantaneous rate of change would be exactly zero at some point in time. Sketch a graph of this situation. Explain why the slope is zero at that point. 5.14.9 Comparing Instantaneous Rates Below is a plot of soil moisture over time after a rainstorm. Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 1\\) and \\(t = 5\\) by drawing tangent lines. Compare the magnitudes of the two slopes. Explain what this says about how quickly the soil is drying over time. 5.14.10 From Instantaneous to Prediction The temperature in a tide pool is changing at a rate given by: \\[ \\frac{dT}{dt} = -0.3 \\quad \\text{(deg C per hour)} \\] at \\(t = 5\\) hours after sunrise, and the temperature at that time is 22.5 deg C. Use this instantaneous rate to predict the temperature one hour later, assuming the rate stays constant. Explain whether this is likely to be an overestimate or underestimate in a real tide pool system, and why. 5.15 Practice: Limit Definition of a Derivative In this section, you’ll practice the core mathematical manipulations needed to compute derivatives directly from their limit definition. While shortcut rules for differentiation are faster, the limit definition is the foundation that makes those rules possible. Working through examples at specific points, for general functions, and with small numerical approximations will strengthen your algebra skills and deepen your understanding of where derivatives come from. You’ll also explore cases where limits fail (corners, jumps), and apply the definition to real data and environmental contexts. By the end, you should feel comfortable setting up and simplifying the difference quotient, interpreting results with correct units, and explaining why limits are essential to the concept of instantaneous change. 5.15.1 Basic Derivative at a Point Use the limit definition of the derivative to compute \\(f&#39;(3)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] 5.15.2 General Derivative from Limit Definition Using the limit definition, find the derivative function \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = 5x - 7 \\] 5.15.3 Cubic Function at a Point Compute \\(f&#39;(2)\\) using the limit definition for: \\[ f(x) = x^3 \\] 5.15.4 Estimate with Small \\(h\\) Sometimes it’s easier to estimate a derivative numerically when the exact limit is messy. Use: \\[ f&#39;(a) \\approx \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] with \\(h = 0.001\\) to estimate \\(f&#39;(4)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\] Explain why this approximation works for smooth functions. 5.15.5 Environmental Example: Tree Height Growth Let \\(H(t) = 2.5\\sqrt{t}\\) represent the height (m) of a young tree after \\(t\\) years. Use \\(h = 0.0001\\) to estimate \\(H&#39;(1)\\). Estimate \\(H&#39;(5)\\) Interpret your answer in words, what is happening to the growth rate? 5.15.6 When the Limit Fails to Exist: Corner Consider: \\[ f(x) = |x - 2| \\] - Use the limit definition of a derivative from the left and right at \\(x = 2\\). - Explain why \\(f&#39;(2)\\) does not exist. 5.15.7 When the Limit Fails to Exist: Jump Let: \\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} 3x + 1, &amp; x &lt; 1 \\\\ x^2, &amp; x \\geq 1 \\end{cases} \\] - Use the limit definition of the derivative from each side at \\(x = 1\\). - Explain why the derivative fails to exist at that point. 5.15.8 Estimate from Real Data The dissolved oxygen (DO) in a lake was measured over several days: Day DO (mg/L) 4.9 8.15 5.0 8.10 5.1 8.05 Use \\(h = 0.1\\) and the limit definition of a derivative to estimate the instantaneous rate of change at \\(t = 5.0\\). Include units in your answer. 5.15.9 Derivative of a Quadratic For: \\[ f(x) = 3x^2 - 4x + 5 \\] 1. Derive \\(f&#39;(x)\\) using the limit definition. 2. Now examine you answer, what happened to the \\(3x^2\\) term? What about the \\(4x\\) term? What about the \\(5\\)? 5.15.10 Challenge: Fractional Function Using the limit definition, find \\(f&#39;(x)\\) for: \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\] 1. State the domain for which the derivative exists. 2. Explain why \\(x = 0\\) must be excluded. 5.16 Practice: Environmental “Explain and Explore” Prompts 5.16.1 Introduction Having practiced the mechanics of the limit definition, you now have the tools to calculate derivatives from first principles. In the next section, we’ll step back from the algebra and focus on the bigger picture: how rates of change help us interpret environmental systems and real-world data. In this section, you’ll shift from practicing the mechanics of the limit definition to exploring how derivatives help us understand real environmental systems. The goal here is not to calculate every derivative by hand, but to think about what the rate of change means in context—whether it’s the growth of a fish population, the retreat of a glacier, or the decline of dissolved oxygen in a lake. You’ll connect mathematical concepts like slopes and instantaneous change to real-world data, scenarios, and management questions. By the end, you should be able to explain in your own words how derivatives provide insight into environmental patterns and processes, and why they are a powerful tool for interpreting change. 5.16.2 Marine Biology Describe a marine ecosystem where tracking a population. - What rates would be of interest? - What kind of data would you need to compute it? 5.16.3 Forestry Think of a forest growth or health measure. - How would knowing the derivative help inform forest management decisions? - What tools or data sets could you use to estimate it? 5.16.4 Climate Science Choose a climate-related variable. - What insight would the derivative give about changes in this variable? - How might the time scale of measurement (daily vs. yearly) affect your interpretation? 5.16.5 Freshwater Ecology Identify a lake, river, or wetland variable that changes in response to seasonal cycles. Describe a situation where you would want to know its rate of change. What measurement frequency would be needed to detect rapid changes? 5.16.6 Human–Environment Interaction Pick a human activity that influences an environmental variable. - How would you use the derivative to monitor and evaluate the impact? - What kinds of monitoring programs or data sets could provide the necessary data?

How can you interpret a derivative from a graph, dataset, or equation? What does derivative notation mean, and how does it connect to context? How could you apply derivatives to a real-world environmental example? Notes: 6.2 Understanding the Speed of Change A derivative is about how fast something is changing, right now, and in what direction. 6.2.1 Class Brainstorm: What’s Changing? Activity: As a group, pick an environmental system you are interested in (e.g. Lake Washington). Discuss: What quantity is changing in that system? What is it changing with respect to (time, distance, depth, etc.)? Why might the speed of change matter for scientists, managers, or communities? Rinse and repeat, can you think of another quantity or variable that is changing in your system? Share your group’s example with the class. Notes: 6.2.2 Average vs Right-Now: Build the Contrast Practice: Using your scenario: What average rate of change could you compute between two times? What would the instantaneous rate tell you “right now”? How would the decisions based on these two rates differ? Notes: 6.2.3 Graph Interpretation: Slope as a Story Activity (no equations needed): Sketch a simple curve of your quantity vs. its input (e.g., population vs. time). Mark one place slope is positive (increase). Mark one place slope is near zero (flat). Mark one place slope is negative (decrease). For each mark, write a one-sentence story of what’s happening. What does the steepness tell you about your quantity? Notes: 6.2.4 From Monitoring to Action Practice: Imagine you only have resources to collect limited data. When would an average rate be most useful? When would you need an instantaneous rate? What extra data (resolution, sensors) would help improve your estimates? Notes: 6.3 Why We Need New Math Tools 6.3.1 Compare: Snapshots vs. Speed Activity (Whole Class Scenario + Small Groups): Scenario: A coastal city is monitoring sea level rise to plan future flood defenses. Snapshot: “Sea level is currently 1.2 meters above the baseline.” Speed: “Sea level is rising at 4 mm per year.” Step 1: Snapshot vs. Speed What can the snapshot alone tell the city planners? What critical information is missing if they only have the snapshot? How does the speed of change alter the urgency of decisions? Step 2: Consequences of Missing Information If planners only use the snapshot, what mistakes could they make? If they only use the speed, what context would be missing? Why do they need both? Step 3: Push Further How would decisions differ if the speed of rise is constant vs. accelerating? What additional data (short-term vs. long-term) would make predictions more reliable? Step 4: Generalize Complete this sentence as a group: In environmental systems, a snapshot tells us ________, but the derivative tells us ________. Notes: 6.4 What Is a Derivative? We’ve seen examples where snapshots (a single measurement) and speed (how fast something changes) both matter. The derivative is the mathematical tool that lets us capture that “speed of change” precisely. 6.4.1 Spot the Derivative in Disguise Activity (Pairs or Small Groups): Below are phrases from different fields. Circle or underline the ones that represent a rate of change — in other words, a derivative in disguise. A glacier loses 2 km² of area per year Dissolved oxygen drops by 1 mg/L per meter of depth Tree canopy cover increases by 5% per kilometer toward the city center The tide is rising at 5 cm per hour Soil carbon decreases by 0.3 g per kilogram of soil nitrogen Ocean salinity is 34 parts per million Ocean salinity increases by 0.2 ppt per 100 km toward the equator CO₂ levels are increasing by 2.5 ppm per year A lake is 12°C in July Mountain snowpack decreases by 10 cm per 100 m of elevation gain The pH of a stream is 6.5 The pH of a stream drops by 0.1 units per kilometer downstream of a mine Forest biomass is 400 tons of carbon per hectare Forest biomass has been increasing by 3 tons per hectare per year Wind speed increases by 0.5 m/s per 10 m of height Annual rainfall totals 1200 mm Rainfall intensity rises by 2 mm per minute during a storm Nitrogen leaching is 4 kg/ha Nitrogen leaching rises by 0.1 kg per mm of irrigation applied Discuss: - Which are true derivatives? - Which are just static descriptions or ratios? - How can you tell the difference? Notes: 6.4.2 Tell the Story of the Math Activity (Whole Class): Consider the formula: \\[ \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} \\] What do the symbols mean in plain language? How does this formula connect to “rise over run” from algebra? How could you explain this to a high school student using a real-world environmental example? Notes: 6.4.3 Reflection Prompt: Complete this thought: A derivative is not just a formula — it’s a way of describing ________. Notes: 6.5 Average Rate of Change The average rate of change tells us how much something changes per unit of input (like time, distance, or depth) over a chosen interval. Mathematically, it’s the slope of a secant line connecting two points on a function. 6.5.1 Practice: Secant Slope on a Graph Activity (Individual or Pairs): Look at the quadratic function below. \\[f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + 5\\] Pick two points on the curve. Estimate their coordinates. Use the formula below to compute the average rate of change. \\[\\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}\\] What does the sign of your slope tell you about how the function is changing? Write a descriptive sentence about what your value represents Notes: 6.5.2 Practice: Environmental Table Activity (Small Groups): The table below shows the amount of carbon stored in forest soil over time. Year Carbon (kg/m²) 2000 4.1 2005 4.8 2010 5.0 Compute the average rate of change from 2000 to 2005. Compute the average rate of change from 2005 to 2010. Compute the average rate of change from 2000 to 2010. Write one or two sentences explaining what these numbers mean in the context of carbon storage. Notes: 6.5.3 Practice: Application to Sea Level Activity (Whole Class Discussion): Suppose sea level in a coastal region is modeled by \\[S(t) = 3.2t + 45\\] where \\(S(t)\\) is in millimeters and \\(t\\) is years since 2000. Calculate the average rate of change of \\(S(t)\\) from 2010 to 2020. State the units of your result. Interpret the meaning: what does this tell us about sea level trends? Is there a shortcut to finding the average rate of change? Visualize this function with a sketch, add in the secant line, what do you notice? Notes: 6.6 Instantaneous Rate of Change The instantaneous rate of change tells us how fast something is changing at a specific moment. Unlike the average rate, which looks at an interval, the instantaneous rate captures the slope of the tangent line at a single point. This is the essence of a derivative. 6.6.1 Zooming In on Change Activity (Whole Class Demonstration): Look at the function below. As a class, discuss: What does the slope of the curve at 2010 represent? Imagine drawing a tangent line right at that point. How is this different from a secant line? How might the meaning of this slope change if this were a glacier, a population, or a pollutant concentration? Notes: 6.6.2 Tangent Hunt Activity (Pairs): On the curve below: Mark one point where the tangent slope is clearly positive. Mark one point where the tangent slope is clearly negative. Mark one point where the tangent slope is zero. When does the sign of the tangent slope change? Where is change happening the fastest? (positive and negative) Discuss: What does each slope mean in an environmental context (e.g., population peak, fastest growth, fastest decline)? Break up the function into regions and tell a story. Notes: Challenge: Can you sketch the derivative - dont worry about getting the right magnitudes, just the right shape. [Hint: start with some points you know for sure, then ask yourself as you move left to right what is happening to the slope] 6.6.3 Practice: Bear Growth Scenario Activity (Small Groups): Imagine tracking the weight of a bear throughout its life. Sketch or imagine the weight vs. age curve. Where is the slope (rate of change) steepest? Where does the slope flatten out? Could it ever become negative? Group Discussion: Why might wildlife managers care about whether the rate of weight gain is accelerating or decelerating? Notes: Now try sketching the derivative, or the rate of change of the bear’s weight. 6.6.4 Data to Derivative Activity (Hands-On, with Data Table): You measure dissolved oxygen in a lake for three consecutive days: Day DO (mg/L) 4.0 8.15 5.0 8.10 6.0 8.05 Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at Day 4, 5 and 6 using the formula: \\[f&#39;(a) \\approx \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}\\] with \\(h = 1\\). Interpret your result in context, including units. Was it possible to calculate the instantaneous rate of change at day 6? How would a higher-resolution dataset (more frequent measurements) improve your estimate? Notes: REMEMBER: We are just estimating here! If h is small enough its a good estimate, if h is big, well it becomes the ‘average’ rate of change. Discuss: Is this more of an average or instantaneous rate of change? 6.6.5 Instantaneous vs. Average Activity (Class Discussion): Compare these two statements: A glacier retreats 20 meters per year between 2000 and 2010. On January 1st 2005, the glacier front is moving backward at 3.5 meters per year. Which is an average rate? Which is instantaneous? What added information do you get (or can deduce) when you have both pieces of information? Why does the distinction matter for scientists, policymakers, or communities? Brainstorm 2–3 other examples where average vs. instantaneous rates tell very different stories. Notes: 6.7 The Limit Definition of a Derivative We don’t do many proofs in this class, but understanding the mathematical origins of the derivative really helps with interpretation. So we will work through this one together. 6.7.1 Deriving the Limit Definition with a Real Example — Seattle Daylight We’ll use a simple model of daylight hours in Seattle (approx. 47.6°N) to build the derivative from limits. A realistic sinusoidal model for daylight hours \\(D(t)\\) (in hours) on day \\(t\\) of the year is: \\[ D(t) \\;=\\; 12.25 \\;+\\; 3.75 \\,\\cos\\!\\Big(\\tfrac{2\\pi}{365}\\,(t - 172)\\Big) \\] Midline \\(\\approx 12.25\\) hours Amplitude \\(\\approx 3.75\\) hours Let’s first build an intuition for what daylight hours look like over a year in Seattle. Sketch what you think the curve looks like (peak near late June, minimum near late December), then compare to the model above. Annotate interesting points along this function. 6.7.2 Connect to the Question Activity (Think-Pair-Share): Lets pick a specific day \\(a=250\\) (day 250 ≈ early Sep). What does \\(D(a)\\) represent in words? If you only know \\(D(a)\\) and \\(D(a+h)\\), how would you estimate “how fast daylight is changing around day \\(a\\)” using the average rate of change? Why might we want the instantaneous rate of change instead? Notes: 6.7.3 From Average to Instant: The Difference Quotient Step 1 — Average Rate on \\([a, a+h]\\): Write the average rate of change of daylight hours between day \\(a\\) and day \\(a+h\\) where \\(h=10\\): Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250 13.26 260 12.61 270 11.96 \\[ \\frac{D(a+h) - D(a)}{h} \\] What does the numerator represent in context? What are the units of this average rate? Notes: Step 2 — Shrink the Interval: To get the rate “right now” on day \\(a\\), we take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\): \\[ D&#39;(a) \\;=\\; \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{D(a+h) - D(a)}{h} \\] So if we use the data below we can see we are shrinking our \\(h\\) getting it close to \\(0\\). Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250 13.259 251 13.195 252 13.131 Calculate the average rate of change with an \\(h=1\\) What if we shrink the interval even further and make \\(h=0.01\\) Day of Year Daylight Hours (hrs) 250.00 13.259240 250.01 13.258602 250.02 13.257965 Why can’t we just set \\(h=0\\) directly? In words, what does this limit do with the two-day comparison? Notes: Challenge: In your groups discuss this table, what do you notice on both ends of the table? h Average Rate of Change (hrs/day) 365 0.000000 300 0.009487 200 -0.002907 100 -0.046478 50 -0.062121 10 -0.064676 1 -0.063844 0.1 -0.063732 0.01 -0.063721 0.001 -0.063720 0.00001 -0.063720 Technically what have found here is an estimate for the instantanous rate of change at a point 6.7.4 Visualizing Secant \\(\\to\\) Tangent (Seattle Daylight) Using the plot below, sketch: The secant at day 250 with \\(h=365\\) Now draw another secant with \\(h=300\\) Now draw it with \\(h=50\\) Finally sketch the tangent at \\(h=250\\) Remember the average rate of change equation is just rise over run or the slope of the secant lines, so the slopes of the lines are what tell us the rate of change 6.7.5 Read What the Slope Means Interpretation: Using your numerical/visual estimate of \\(D&#39;(a)\\): If \\(D&#39;(a) &gt; 0\\), what does that say about the season and daylight change? If \\(D&#39;(a) &lt; 0\\), what time of year might that correspond to? If \\(D&#39;(a) \\approx 0\\), what’s happening seasonally? Notes: 6.7.6 Why Limits Matter (Wrap-Up) Prompt: Explain—in your own words—why the limit is essential for defining the instantaneous rate of change, using the Seattle daylight model as your example. Notes: 6.8 Introducing Limit Notation We now need a way to formalize what happens as we “zoom in” on a function — this is where the idea of a limit comes in. 6.8.1 Building Intuition Activity (Think-Pair-Share): Imagine a pollutant concentration in a river, \\(C(x)\\), as you move downstream toward a factory outfall. At 0.9 km downstream, \\(C = 4.9\\) mg/L At 0.99 km, \\(C = 4.99\\) mg/L At 0.999 km, \\(C = 4.999\\) mg/L As you move closer to 1 km, what value does the concentration seem to be approaching? This “approaching behavior” is what we call the limit. Notes: 6.8.2 Symbol and Words Practice: The formal symbol is: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to a} f(x) \\] What does the arrow (\\(\\to\\)) mean? What does the \\(a\\) represent? What is \\(f(x)\\) approaching as \\(x\\) gets closer to \\(a\\)? Notes: 6.8.3 Why Not Just Plug In? Discussion Prompt: Sometimes \\(f(a)\\) is undefined (like dividing by zero). In fact - when we look at the limit defintion of a derivative, this is the problem we encounter. \\[ f&#39;(a) \\;=\\; \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Notes: 6.8.4 One-Sided Limits Activity (Small Groups): We can approach a point from the left (\\(a^-\\)) or from the right (\\(a^+\\)). Sketch a graph where the left-hand and right-hand limits are the same. Sketch a graph where they are different. Can you link this to a real-world example? Notes: 6.9 From Average to Instantaneous: The Role of Limits We want to connect the average rate of change to the instantaneous rate of change. Start with the average rate formula: \\[ \\text{Average Rate on } [a,b] = \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] 6.9.1 Scaffold the Derivation Practice (Step by Step): Start with the formula for the average rate of change between two points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\): \\[ \\frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \\] What does the numerator mean? What does the denominator mean? Introduce a new variable \\(h = b-a\\). Rewrite the denominator in terms of \\(h\\). Replace \\(b\\) with \\(a+h\\). Show that the formula becomes: \\[ \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Why is this still the average rate of change, just written differently? Try to explain this with a sketch. Now imagine shrinking the interval smaller and smaller: let \\(h \\to 0\\). This makes the slope of secant line approach the slope of the tangent line. What problem happens if you just set \\(h=0\\)? How does the limit fix this? Add in the limit notation Arrive at the definition of the derivative: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Notes: Let’s annotate this equation so we know what everything is and what to do with it. \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] 6.10 Finding the Derivative Using the Limit Definition of a Derivative We’ll now practice moving from the definition of the derivative to actually computing one. Remember, the derivative at a point \\(a\\) is defined as: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] We are going to take this one step at a time: We’ll deal with the numerator We’ll add in the fraction term We’ll add the limit 6.10.1 Step 1: Setup the equations Activity: Suppose we have the function: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\] We want to find the derivative at \\(x = 2\\). Write down the limit definition of the derivative at \\(a = 2\\). Substitute \\(a = 2\\) into the formula (but don’t simplify yet). What expression do you now have? Notes: 6.10.2 Step 2: Expand the Numerator Activity: The numerator is: \\[ f(2+h) - f(2) \\] Compute \\(f(2+h)\\). Compute \\(f(2)\\). Subtract them to simplify the numerator. Write your result in expanded form. Notes: 6.10.3 Step 3: Simplify the Difference Quotient Activity: Now substitute your numerator back into: \\[ \\frac{f(2+h) - f(2)}{h} \\] Factor/simplify if possible. What cancels out? Why is this helpful? Notes: 6.10.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: Finally, take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\). Substitute \\(h = 0\\) after simplification. What value do you get for \\(f&#39;(2)\\)? Interpret: What does this mean in terms of the slope of the tangent line? Notes: You’ve found the derivative at a point \\(a=2\\) 6.10.5 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number like 2. Start with: \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} \\] Expand \\(f(x+h)\\) and subtract \\(f(x)\\). Simplify and take the limit. What is the general derivative function of \\(f(x) = x^2\\)? Notes: You’ve now found the derivative function 6.11 Workbook: More Practice with the Limit Definition Now let’s apply the same step-by-step process to two new functions. Work carefully through each scaffold — the algebra will get trickier, but the structure is the same. 6.11.1 Example 1: \\(f(x) = x^3\\) We’ll find the derivative of \\(f(x) = x^3\\) at a point, and then generalize. 6.11.1.1 Step 1: Write the Definition Activity: Start with the limit definition: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Substitute \\(f(x) = x^3\\). Don’t expand yet, just write down the expression. Notes: 6.11.1.2 Step 2: Expand Activity: - Expand \\((a+h)^3\\). - Subtract \\(a^3\\). - Simplify your numerator. Notes: 6.11.1.3 Step 3: Simplify the Fraction Activity: - Divide the numerator by \\(h\\). - Cancel common factors where possible. - What remains? Notes: 6.11.1.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: - Let \\(h \\to 0\\). - What’s left? - Interpret: What does this slope mean for the cubic function at \\(x=a\\)? Notes: 6.11.2 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number \\(a\\). What is the derivative function? Notes: 6.11.3 Example 2: \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 7x\\) This time, the function is a polynomial. Let’s find its derivative using the limit definition. 6.11.3.1 Step 1: Write the Definition Activity: - Start with: \\[ f&#39;(a) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h} \\] Substitute \\(f(x) = 3x^2 + 7x\\). Notes: 6.11.3.2 Step 2: Expand Activity: - Expand \\(3(a+h)^2 + 7(a+h)\\). - Subtract \\((3a^2 + 7a)\\). - Simplify your numerator. Notes: 6.11.3.3 Step 3: Simplify the Fraction Activity: - Factor out \\(h\\) from the numerator. - Cancel the denominator. - What remains? Notes: 6.11.3.4 Step 4: Take the Limit Activity: - Let \\(h \\to 0\\). - State the result clearly as \\(f&#39;(x)\\). - Interpret: How do the terms \\(3x^2\\) and \\(7x\\) each behave under differentiation? Notes: 6.11.4 Step 5: Generalize Activity: Repeat the same process, but this time use \\(x\\) instead of a fixed number \\(a\\). What is the derivative function? Notes: 6.11.5 Example 3: Environmental Application — Glacier Retreat Suppose the area of a glacier (in km\\(^2\\)) is modeled by: \\[ G(t) = 100 - 2t - 0.1t^2 \\] where \\(t\\) is years since 2000. We want to compute the instantaneous rate of change of glacier area at \\(t = 10\\). Practice (Small Groups): 1. Write the limit definition for \\(G&#39;(10)\\). 2. Compute \\(G(10+h)\\). 3. Subtract \\(G(10)\\). 4. Divide by \\(h\\). 5. Simplify. 6. Take the limit as \\(h \\to 0\\). Discussion: - What does the sign of \\(G&#39;(10)\\) tell you about the glacier at that time? - How would you explain your result to a policymaker?
