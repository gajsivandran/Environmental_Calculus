Give an example of a real system that might show this pattern. Suggested Answer The variable is increasing on that interval. Examples include lake temperature rising through the morning, snowpack depth increasing during a storm, or early-stage population growth. A population model has a point where \\(P&#39;(t) = 0\\) but \\(P&#39;&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\). Explain what is happening biologically at that moment. Suggested Answer The population has reached a peak. Growth has slowed to zero, and the negative second derivative shows decline is beginning due to limits like resources or space. Why is an inflection point important in environmental systems? Describe a situation where identifying the moment when concavity changes could be useful. Suggested Answer An inflection point marks when the rate of change switches from accelerating to decelerating. Useful examples include algae transitioning from rapid bloom to nutrient-limited slowdown or a streamflow peak transitioning to recession. If a function has a horizontal asymptote as \\(x \\to +\\infty\\), what does that usually represent in ecological or physical models? Suggested Answer A long-term limiting value. Examples: carrying capacity, maximum nutrient uptake, equilibrium storage or temperature. A function has a vertical asymptote at \\(x = 3\\). What does this mean, and what environmental boundary might behave this way? Suggested Answer The function becomes undefined at \\(x=3\\) and approaches ±∞. Environmental analogies include thresholds like pore pressure reaching critical limits or denominators representing zero volume remaining. You are given only a derivative graph \\(f&#39;(x)\\). How can you determine where the original function is increasing or decreasing, has maxima/minima, or is concave up/down? Suggested Answer Increasing where \\(f&#39;&gt;0\\), decreasing where \\(f&#39;&lt;0\\). A max occurs where \\(f&#39;\\) changes +→– and a min where –→+. Concavity depends on whether \\(f&#39;\\) is rising (concave up) or falling (concave down). The second derivative of a function is positive for all \\(x\\). What does this tell you about the shape of the curve? Suggested Answer The function is concave up everywhere. This could represent accelerating recovery or compounding growth after disturbance. A logistic-style function changes concavity at exactly one value of \\(x\\). What does that point represent in system dynamics? Suggested Answer It is the inflection point—the moment of maximum growth rate, where growth switches from accelerating to slowing. If \\(f&#39;(x)\\) is always positive but decreases toward zero as \\(x \\to \\infty\\), how would the graph look? What real process behaves this way? Suggested Answer The function increases but levels off toward a horizontal asymptote. Examples include nutrient uptake saturation, long-term warming trends, or logistic population limits. An environmental dataset increases, then decreases, then increases again. What must the sign of the derivative look like? Suggested Answer The derivative must be +, then –, then +. Causes could include seasonal cycles, predator–prey oscillations, or storm hydrograph rise–fall–rise sequences. If two functions both satisfy \\(f&#39;(a)=0\\), must they have the same type of extremum at \\(x=a\\)? Explain. Suggested Answer No. A horizontal tangent could be a max, min, saddle, or flat point. The behavior depends on sign changes in \\(f&#39;\\) or on \\(f&#39;&#39;(a)\\). A function’s rate of change increases rapidly, then levels off. What does this say about \\(f&#39;\\) and \\(f&#39;&#39;\\)? Suggested Answer \\(f&#39;&gt;0\\) throughout. \\(f&#39;&#39;&gt;0\\) during the acceleration phase, then \\(f&#39;&#39;&lt;0\\) as growth slows. This is typical of logistic or saturation processes. In an environmental time series, what does it mean if \\(f&#39;&#39;(t) &lt; 0\\) while \\(f&#39;(t) &gt; 0\\)? Suggested Answer The variable is increasing but at a slowing rate. Examples: warming lake approaching equilibrium, population nearing carrying capacity. Suppose a function has an inflection point at \\(x=5\\). What does this tell you about system behavior on each side? Suggested Answer Concavity switches sign at 5. The system moves from accelerating to slowing change (or vice versa), marking a transition in dynamics. Why is a vertical asymptote different from a point where the derivative is undefined? Suggested Answer A vertical asymptote means the function itself blows up to ±∞. A derivative can be undefined even when the function is finite (corners, cusps). These reflect different structural vs. behavioral limitations. A streamflow model reaches a maximum at \\(t=7\\) hours. What does this say about the hydrologic process? Suggested Answer Before 7 hr, discharge increases; after, it decreases. This marks peak flow, when routing and inputs balance before recession dominates. A derivative graph shows a long flat region where \\(f&#39;(x) \\approx 0\\). What might this indicate? Suggested Answer The system is experiencing very little change. Examples: midday temperature plateau, stable soil moisture, population near carrying capacity. Why is the quadratic formula useful when analyzing derivatives? Suggested Answer Many derivatives simplify to quadratics. Finding extrema or inflection points requires solving \\(f&#39;=0\\) or \\(f&#39;&#39;=0\\), and the quadratic formula works even when factoring doesn’t. If a function always has a small but positive derivative, how would you describe the shape? Suggested Answer It increases gradually with no peaks or sharp transitions. Examples include slow climate warming, gradual biomass growth, or long-term CO₂ trends. A model has a horizontal asymptote at \\(y=120\\). What does this say about long-term system behavior? Suggested Answer The system approaches a stable upper limit, such as a carrying capacity, saturation level, or maximum equilibrium value. A function has \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} f(x)=8. \\] What does this horizontal asymptote tell you about the long-term behavior of the system being modeled? Suggested Answer The system approaches and stabilizes around 8 as the input variable becomes very large. This represents a long-term equilibrium such as a carrying capacity, saturation point, or thermal equilibrium. Given \\[ f(x)=\\frac{5x}{x-4}, \\] identify the vertical asymptote and describe the behavior of the function as \\(x\\) approaches that asymptote from the left and from the right. Suggested Answer The vertical asymptote is at \\(x=4\\). As \\(x\\to 4^-\\), the denominator is negative and very small, so \\(f(x)\\to -\\infty\\). As \\(x\\to 4^+\\), the denominator is positive and very small, so \\(f(x)\\to +\\infty\\). Explain the difference between approaching a horizontal asymptote from above vs. approaching it from below. What does each imply about the sign of the derivative for large \\(x\\)? Suggested Answer Approaching from above means the function is decreasing toward the asymptote, so \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) for large \\(x\\). Approaching from below means the function is increasing toward the asymptote, so \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) for large \\(x\\). A function has two vertical asymptotes at \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). What does this imply about the domain and structure of the graph? Suggested Answer The domain excludes \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=3\\). The graph is broken into three disconnected pieces, each with potentially different behavior (increasing/decreasing, concavity, extrema), since the function cannot cross those asymptotes. A rational function approaches the horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\) as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). Give a real-world environmental process that might behave this way. Suggested Answer Examples include pollutant concentration decaying toward zero, cooling curves approaching ambient temperature, radioactive decay processes, or stream velocity decreasing to near zero as flood waters recede. Practice Problems Problem 1 — Clean Cubic Example Consider the function \\[ f(x) = x^3 - 3x. \\] Use derivatives and sign charts to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x) = 3(x-1)(x+1). \\] Check critical points \\[ f&#39;(x)=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=-1,\\;1. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=6x. \\] Check inflection point \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=0. \\] Full solution Start with \\[ f(x)=x^3 - 3x. \\] 1. First derivative (with factoring) \\[ f&#39;(x)=3x^2 - 3. \\] Factor the derivative: \\[ 3x^2 - 3 = 3(x^2 - 1) = 3(x-1)(x+1). \\] Critical points solve \\[ 3(x-1)(x+1)=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=-1,\\;1. \\] Sign of the derivative: - For \\(x&lt;-1\\): both factors negative → \\(f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) - For \\(-1&lt;x&lt;1\\): one positive, one negative → \\(f&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) - For \\(x&gt;1\\): both positive → \\(f&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) So the function is: - Increasing on \\((-\\infty,-1)\\) - Decreasing on \\((-1,1)\\) - Increasing on \\((1,\\infty)\\) Thus: - Local maximum at \\(x=-1\\) - Local minimum at \\(x=1\\) 2. Second derivative (with factoring) \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=6x. \\] Solve \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)=0\\): \\[ 6x=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=0. \\] Sign of second derivative: - \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) for \\(x&lt;0\\) → concave down - \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) for \\(x&gt;0\\) → concave up Thus \\(x=0\\) is an inflection point. Putting together the behavior: Increasing → decreasing → increasing Concave down for \\(x&lt;0\\) Concave up for \\(x&gt;0\\) Local max at \\(x=-1\\) Local min at \\(x=1\\) Inflection at \\(x=0\\) Problem 2 — Symmetric Quartic Consider the function \\[ f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2. \\] Use derivatives and sign charts to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x) = 4x(x^2 - 2). \\] Check critical points \\[ x = 0,\\quad x = \\pm\\sqrt{2}. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = 4(3x^2 - 2). \\] Check inflection point \\[ x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}. \\] Full solution Start with \\[ f(x)=x^4 - 4x^2. \\] 1. First derivative (with factoring) \\[ f&#39;(x)=4x^3 - 8x = 4x(x^2 - 2). \\] Critical points solve \\[ 4x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 0,\\; \\pm\\sqrt{2}. \\] Sign of derivative: - For \\(x &lt; -\\sqrt{2}\\): \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) - For \\(-\\sqrt{2} &lt; x &lt; 0\\): \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) - For \\(0 &lt; x &lt; \\sqrt{2}\\): \\(f&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) - For \\(x &gt; \\sqrt{2}\\): \\(f&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) Thus: - Local max at \\(x = 0\\) - Local mins at \\(x = \\pm\\sqrt{2}\\) 2. Second derivative (with factoring) \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=12x^2 - 8 = 4(3x^2 - 2). \\] Solve \\[ 3x^2 - 2 = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\pm\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2}{3}}. \\] Concavity: - Down for \\(|x| &lt; \\sqrt{2/3}\\) - Up for \\(|x| &gt; \\sqrt{2/3}\\) Problem 3 — Rational Function With Simple Roots Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x}{x^2 + 1}. \\] Use derivatives and sign charts to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{1 - x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Check critical points \\[ x = \\pm 1. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = \\frac{-2x(x^2+3)}{(x^2+1)^3}. \\] Check inflection point \\[ x = 0. \\] Full solution Start with \\[ f(x)=\\frac{x}{x^2+1}. \\] 1. First derivative (with factoring) Apply the quotient rule: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{(1)(x^2+1) - x(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} = \\frac{x^2+1 - 2x^2}{(x^2+1)^2} = \\frac{1 - x^2}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Critical points solve \\[ 1 - x^2 = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = \\pm 1. \\] Derivative sign: \\(x &lt; -1\\): \\(1 - x^2 &lt; 0\\) → decreasing \\(-1 &lt; x &lt; 1\\): \\(1 - x^2 &gt; 0\\) → increasing \\(x &gt; 1\\): \\(1 - x^2 &lt; 0\\) → decreasing Thus: - Local min at \\(x=-1\\) - Local max at \\(x=1\\) 2. Second derivative (with factoring) \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = \\frac{-2x(x^2+3)}{(x^2+1)^3}. \\] Set numerator to zero: \\[ -2x(x^2+3)=0. \\] Since \\(x^2+3 &gt; 0\\), \\[ x = 0 \\] is the only inflection point. Concavity: \\(x &lt; 0\\): \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &gt; 0\\) → concave up \\(x &gt; 0\\): \\(f&#39;&#39;(x) &lt; 0\\) → concave down Problem 4 — Exponential Product With Clean Factors Consider the function \\[ f(x) = x^2 e^{-x}. \\] Use derivatives and sign charts to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x) = e^{-x}x(2 - x). \\] Check critical points \\[ x = 0,\\quad x = 2. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = e^{-x}(x^2 - 4x + 2). \\] Check inflection points \\[ x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}. \\] Full solution Start with \\[ f(x)=x^2 e^{-x}. \\] 1. First derivative (with factoring) Use the product rule: \\[ f&#39;(x) = (2x)e^{-x} + x^2(-e^{-x}) = e^{-x}(2x - x^2) = e^{-x}x(2 - x). \\] Critical points come from \\[ e^{-x}x(2-x)=0. \\] Since \\(e^{-x} \\neq 0\\), solutions are \\[ x=0,\\quad x=2. \\] Sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\): For \\(x&lt;0\\): \\(x&lt;0\\), \\(2-x&gt;0\\) → negative → decreasing For \\(0&lt;x&lt;2\\): positive × positive → positive → increasing For \\(x&gt;2\\): positive × negative → negative → decreasing Thus: - Local minimum at \\(x=0\\) - Local maximum at \\(x=2\\) 2. Second derivative (with factoring) Differentiate \\[ f&#39;(x)=e^{-x}(2x - x^2). \\] Using product rule again: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=e^{-x}(-1)(2x - x^2) + e^{-x}(2 - 2x) = e^{-x}(x^2 - 4x + 2). \\] Solve \\[ x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0. \\] Roots: \\[ x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}. \\] Concavity: Up on \\((-\\infty,\\, 2-\\sqrt{2})\\) Down on \\((2-\\sqrt{2},\\, 2+\\sqrt{2})\\) Up on \\((2+\\sqrt{2},\\,\\infty)\\) Problem 5 — Logarithm With Symmetry Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\ln(x^2 + 1). \\] Use derivatives and sign charts to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^2+1}. \\] Check critical points \\[ f&#39;(x)=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=0. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2(1 - x^2)}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Check inflection points \\[ x = \\pm 1. \\] Full solution Start with \\[ f(x)=\\ln(x^2+1). \\] 1. First derivative (with factoring) Use chain rule: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{1}{x^2+1}\\cdot 2x = \\frac{2x}{x^2+1}. \\] Critical point from \\[ \\frac{2x}{x^2+1}=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=0. \\] Sign of \\(f&#39;(x)\\): - For \\(x&lt;0\\): numerator negative → decreasing - For \\(x&gt;0\\): numerator positive → increasing Thus the function is: - Decreasing on \\((-\\infty,0)\\) - Increasing on \\((0,\\infty)\\) So \\(x=0\\) is a local minimum. 2. Second derivative (with factoring) Differentiate \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{2x}{x^2+1}. \\] Using quotient rule: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2(x^2+1) - 2x(2x)}{(x^2+1)^2} =\\frac{2 - 2x^2}{(x^2+1)^2} =\\frac{2(1-x^2)}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Solve \\[ 1 - x^2 = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=\\pm 1. \\] Concavity: - For \\(|x|&lt;1\\): \\(1-x^2&gt;0\\) → concave up - For \\(|x|&gt;1\\): \\(1-x^2&lt;0\\) → concave down Thus \\(x=\\pm 1\\) are inflection points. Problem 6 — Rational Function With a Vertical Asymptote Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2}. \\] Use derivatives, sign charts, and asymptotes to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 1}{(x-2)^2}. \\] Check critical points \\[ x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{6}{(x-2)^3}. \\] Check inflection points None — concavity switches only across the asymptote. Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2}. \\] 1. Domain and asymptote The denominator is zero at \\[ x = 2, \\] so the domain is all real numbers except \\(x=2\\). Thus there is a vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\). 2. First derivative (with factoring) Quotient rule gives \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 1}{(x-2)^2}. \\] Critical points come from the numerator: \\[ x^2 - 4x + 1=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}. \\] The derivative is undefined at the vertical asymptote \\(x=2\\). 3. Second derivative (with factoring) \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{6}{(x-2)^3}. \\] Sign analysis: For \\(x&lt;2\\): denominator \\(&lt;0\\) → \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&lt;0\\) → concave down For \\(x&gt;2\\): denominator \\(&gt;0\\) → \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)&gt;0\\) → concave up No inflection points occur within a domain interval — concavity only changes across the asymptote. 4. Behavior near the vertical asymptote To determine the direction of blow-up, compute limits from both sides. Left-hand limit (approach from below) As \\(x\\to 2^-\\): Numerator \\(x^2 - 1 \\to 3\\) (positive) Denominator \\(x - 2 \\to 0^-\\) (negative) Thus \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^-} f(x) = \\frac{3}{0^-} = -\\infty. \\] Right-hand limit (approach from above) As \\(x\\to 2^+\\): Numerator still \\(x^2 - 1 \\to 3\\) Denominator \\(x - 2 \\to 0^+\\) (positive) Thus \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^+} f(x) = \\frac{3}{0^+} = +\\infty. \\] 5. Summary of behavior Vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\) \\(f(x)\\to -\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 2^-\\) \\(f(x)\\to +\\infty\\) as \\(x\\to 2^+\\) Critical points at \\[ x=2-\\sqrt{3},\\quad x=2+\\sqrt{3}. \\] Concavity: Down on \\((-\\infty, 2)\\) Up on \\((2, \\infty)\\) Problem 7 — Rational Function With Two Vertical Asymptotes Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{1}{x(x-2)}. \\] Use derivatives, sign charts, and asymptotes to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x)= -\\frac{2(x-1)}{x^2(x-2)^2}. \\] Check critical points \\[ x = 1. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2(3x^2 - 6x + 4)}{x^3 (x-2)^3}. \\] Check inflection points Solve \\[ 3x^2 - 6x + 4 = 0 \\] No REAL roots Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{1}{x(x-2)}. \\] The denominator is zero at \\[ x = 0,\\qquad x = 2, \\] so these produce vertical asymptotes and the domain is \\[ (-\\infty,0)\\;\\cup\\;(0,2)\\;\\cup\\;(2,\\infty). \\] To compute the first derivative, rewrite the function as \\[ f(x)=[x(x-2)]^{-1}. \\] Differentiating gives \\[ f&#39;(x)=-(x(x-2))^{-2}(2x-2) =-\\frac{2(x-1)}{x^2(x-2)^2}. \\] Critical points come from the numerator: \\[ -2(x-1)=0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x=1. \\] The derivative is undefined at the vertical asymptotes. The second derivative is \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{2(3x^2 - 6x + 4)}{x^3 (x-2)^3}. \\] Second-derivative critical points solve \\[ 3x^2 - 6x + 4=0. \\] Using the quadratic formula, \\[ x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} =\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{36-48}}{6} =\\frac{6\\pm\\sqrt{-12}}{6}. \\] Because the discriminant is negative, the numerator never equals zero, so there are no real inflection points from the second derivative. Concavity changes only when crossing the asymptotes since the denominator changes sign there. To understand the behavior near \\(x=0\\): As \\(x\\to 0^-:\\) denominator \\(0^-\\cdot(-2)=0^+\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 0^-} f(x)=+\\infty. \\] As \\(x\\to 0^+:\\) denominator \\(0^+\\cdot(-2)=0^-\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} f(x)=-\\infty. \\] At \\(x=2\\): As \\(x\\to 2^-:\\) \\((2^-)(0^-)=0^{+}\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^-} f(x)=+\\infty. \\] As \\(x\\to 2^+:\\) \\((2^+)(0^+)=0^{+}\\), so \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^+} f(x)=+\\infty. \\] For the horizontal asymptotes, note that \\[ f(x)=\\frac1{x(x-2)}\\sim \\frac1{x^2} \\] as \\(x\\to\\pm\\infty\\). Thus \\[ \\lim_{x\\to\\pm\\infty} f(x)=0, \\] so the horizontal asymptote is \\[ y=0. \\] In summary: Vertical asymptotes at \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=2\\). Horizontal asymptote \\(y=0\\). One critical point from the first derivative at \\(x=1.\\) No real inflection points because the quadratic in the numerator of \\(f&#39;&#39;\\) has no real roots. Concavity changes only across asymptotes, due to the denominator’s sign. Problem 8 — Logistic-Style Function With Two Horizontal Asymptotes Consider the function \\[ f(x)=\\frac{80}{1+3e^{-0.5x}}. \\] Use derivatives and asymptotes to analyze its behavior. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{120e^{-0.5x}}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^2}. \\] Check critical points The derivative is always positive. \\[ \\text{No critical points (always increasing).} \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{60e^{-0.5x}(3e^{-0.5x}-1)}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^3}. \\] Check inflection point Solve \\[ 3e^{-0.5x}-1=0. \\] \\[ e^{-0.5x}=\\tfrac13. \\] \\[ x = 2\\ln(3). \\] Check horizontal asymptotes \\[ \\lim_{x\\to-\\infty} f(x)=0, \\qquad \\lim_{x\\to+\\infty} f(x)=80. \\] Horizontal asymptotes: \\[ y=0, \\qquad y=80. \\] Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{80}{1+3e^{-0.5x}}. \\] Rewrite the function as \\[ f(x)=80(1+3e^{-0.5x})^{-1}. \\] Differentiate: \\[ f&#39;(x)=80(-1)(1+3e^{-0.5x})^{-2}\\cdot(3e^{-0.5x}\\cdot -0.5) =\\frac{120e^{-0.5x}}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^2}. \\] Since all factors are positive, \\[ f&#39;(x) &gt; 0 \\] for every real \\(x\\). Thus the function is always increasing and has no local maxima or minima. Differentiate again: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{60e^{-0.5x}(3e^{-0.5x}-1)}{(1+3e^{-0.5x})^3}. \\] Set the numerator equal to zero: \\[ 3e^{-0.5x}-1=0 \\] \\[ e^{-0.5x}=\\tfrac13 \\] \\[ x = 2\\ln(3). \\] For \\(e^{-0.5x} &gt; \\frac13\\), the graph is concave up; for \\(e^{-0.5x} &lt; \\frac13\\), the graph is concave down. As \\(x\\to -\\infty\\): \\(e^{-0.5x}\\to\\infty\\), denominator → ∞ \\[ f(x)\\to 0. \\] As \\(x\\to +\\infty\\): \\(e^{-0.5x}\\to 0\\), denominator → 1 \\[ f(x)\\to 80. \\] Thus the function is an increasing logistic curve with a lower horizontal asymptote at \\(y=0\\) and an upper horizontal asymptote at \\(y=80\\), switching concavity at the point \\(x = 2\\ln 3\\). Challenge 1 — Rational Function Consider the function \\[ f(x) = \\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2 + 1}. \\] Analyze the first derivative, second derivative, critical points, and inflection points. Check 1st derivative \\[ f&#39;(x) = \\frac{4x}{(x^2+1)^2}. \\] Check critical points Critical points solve \\(f&#39;(x)=0\\): \\[ 4x = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 0. \\] Check 2nd derivative \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x) = 4\\frac{1 - 3x^2}{(x^2+1)^3}. \\] Check inflection points Solve \\(1 - 3x^2 = 0\\): \\[ x = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}. \\] Full solution We analyze \\[ f(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2}. \\] 1. Domain and asymptote \\[ x - 2 = 0 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad x = 2. \\] Thus the domain is \\[ (-\\infty,2)\\cup(2,\\infty), \\] with a vertical asymptote at \\(x=2\\). 2. First derivative (with factoring) Using the quotient rule: \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{(2x)(x-2) - (x^2 - 1)(1)}{(x-2)^2}. \\] Expand the numerator: \\[ 2x(x-2)=2x^2 - 4x, \\] Subtract the second term: \\[ 2x^2 - 4x - (x^2 - 1) = x^2 - 4x + 1. \\] So the derivative is \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 1}{(x-2)^2}. \\] How the critical points were found Critical points occur when the derivative equals zero and is defined. The denominator \\((x-2)^2\\) is never zero except at \\(x=2\\), where the function is undefined. So we only solve the numerator: \\[ x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0. \\] Apply the quadratic formula: \\[ x=\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4(1)(1)}}{2} =\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 4}}{2} =\\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{12}}{2} =\\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{3}}{2} =2 \\pm \\sqrt{3}. \\] Thus the critical points are: \\[ x=2-\\sqrt{3},\\qquad x=2+\\sqrt{3}. \\] Because the derivative does not exist at \\(x=2\\), that point is not a critical point. 3. Second derivative We start with \\[ f&#39;(x)=\\frac{x^2 - 4x + 1}{(x-2)^2}. \\] Using the quotient rule again: \\[ f&#39;&#39;(x)=\\frac{6}{(x-2)^3}. \\] (Steps omitted here since they were checked previously.) Sign of \\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\\): For \\(x&lt;2\\): denominator negative → concave down For \\(x&gt;2\\): denominator positive → concave up Concavity switches across the vertical asymptote, not within the domain, so there are no inflection points. 4. Limits at the vertical asymptote Left-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^-} f(x) =\\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 2} =\\frac{3}{0^-} =-\\infty. \\] Right-hand limit: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 2^+} f(x) =\\frac{3}{0^+} =+\\infty. \\] Thus: \\(f(x)\\to -\\infty\\) from the left of the asymptote \\(f(x)\\to +\\infty\\) from the right of the asymptote 5.
