# Optimization Workbook

## **What Is Optimization?**

Optimization is the process of finding the **best possible outcome** in a system with limits or tradeoffs. In environmental science, we often want to maximize something beneficial or minimize something harmful, all while respecting ecological, physical, or budget constraints.

### **Key Ideas**

- **A decision variable:**  
  The thing we can change (e.g., planting density, harvest rate, flow release, fertilizer amount).

- **An objective function \( f(x) \):**  
  A mathematical expression that links our decision variable \( x \) to the environmental outcome we care about.

- **A goal:**  
  Either to *maximize* (e.g., carbon uptake, yield, biodiversity) or *minimize* (e.g., pollution, cost, heat stress).

- **Constraints:**  
  The natural or practical limits that shape the feasible range of \( x \).

- **Tradeoffs:**  
  Improving one outcome often reduces another; optimization finds the most effective balance.

- **Derivatives as tools:**  
  - \( f'(x) \) shows where the function is increasing or decreasing.  
  - Critical points (where \( f'(x)=0 \)) are candidates for max/min.  
  - \( f''(x) \) helps determine whether those points are peaks or valleys.

- **Interpretation in context:**  
  The mathematical optimum must be evaluated in ecological, ethical, and practical terms.

### **Why It Matters in Environmental Science**s

Optimization helps us answer questions like:

- What management strategy gives the highest benefit with the lowest impact?  
- How do we use limited resources most efficiently?  
- Where is the “sweet spot” that balances productivity, cost, and sustainability?

In short, optimization allows us to make informed, mathematically justified decisions in complex environmental systems.

**Qualitative Case Study — Finding the Optimal Amount of Sleep**

Everyone knows that sleep matters.  
But the relationship between **hours of sleep** and **how well you function the next day** is not linear.

- Too little sleep leaves you exhausted.  
- Too much sleep can make you groggy or unfocused or perhaps not enough time to do what needs to get done.  
- Somewhere in the middle is your personal “sweet spot.”

The goal of this activity is to help you think like an optimizer *before* we introduce any formulas.

---

**1. Daily Experience (No math yet)**  
Think about a typical night of sleep. Describe, in your own words, what happens when you get:

- Very little sleep (0–3 hours):  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- A moderate amount of sleep (6–9 hours):  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Excessive sleep (11–14 hours):  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**2. What are we optimizing?**  
In this situation:

- What is the **decision variable** (the thing you can adjust)?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- What is the **outcome** you care about (the “objective”)?  

  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Are you trying to **maximize** or **minimize** this outcome?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**3. Describe the general shape**  
Based on your lived experience, sketch how “next-day functioning” should change as sleep hours increase.

---

**4. Identify the “optimal point” qualitatively**  

- Where (roughly) do you think the **maximum** occurs for you?  
  \_\_\_\_\_ hours

- Why does performance fall again after too much sleep?

**Qualitative Case Study — Allocating Study Time Between Two Classes to Optimize GPA**

Imagine you are taking two classes this quarter.  
You start with different grades in each class, and you have limited study time.  
Your goal is to decide **how to split your study hours** to get the **highest possible GPA**.

This activity helps you think about optimization through a real student-centered decision.

---

**1. Your starting point (no math yet)**  
Suppose:

- In **Class A**, you’re starting strong. Your current grade already reflects good understanding.  
- In **Class B**, you’re struggling more. Your current grade is lower and needs improvement.  

Fill in your own version:

- Starting grade in Class A:  
  \_\_\_\_\_%

- Starting grade in Class B:  
  \_\_\_\_\_%

---

**2. What can you control?**  
You cannot instantly change your grades, but you *can* change how you distribute your time.

- What is your **decision variable** here?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Are there one or two decision variables? Explain:  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- What is the **outcome** you want to optimize?  
  (Examples: GPA, average grade, exam performance)  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**3. Think about the tradeoffs**  
Studying more in one class usually means less time for the other. Consider:

- If you spend **almost all** your time on Class A, what happens to Class B?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- If you focus **heavily** on Class B, what happens to Class A?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Why might *neither extreme* be optimal?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**4. Describe the “shape” of each class’s improvement curve**  
Imagine the effect of study hours on each class:

**Class A:**  

- You already understand the material.  
- Extra study helps, but each additional hour helps *less* (diminishing returns).  
Describe the curve qualitatively:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Class B:**  

- You’re behind at the start.  
- The first few hours help *a lot*, but the benefits eventually level off.  
Describe the curve qualitatively:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**5. Putting the system together**  
You have a **fixed number of study hours**, say 10 hours.  
Let:

- \(x\) = hours you spend on Class B  
- \(10 - x\) = hours you spend on Class A  

Without writing formulas, describe how you could:

1. Represent how your grade in Class A depends on \(10 - x\):  
   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2. Represent how your grade in Class B depends on \(x\):  
   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3. Combine the two grades to get an **overall GPA**:  
   \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**6. Identify where the optimum *might* occur**  
Using only reasoning (no calculations):

- If Class B has more “room to grow,” will you likely spend **more time** there or **less**? Why?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- If Class A’s grade cannot change much no matter how much you study, is it worth giving it many hours?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Explain in one sentence where the “balanced” point might be:

You must distribute a **limited amount of stomach space** (or calories) across different foods.

What variable(s) can you control?

In your own words, describe your *main* decision variable(s):  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**4. The tradeoffs**

Think through what happens as you change portions:

Fill in these intuitively:

- If I eat **too little**, I feel:  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- If I eat **too much**, I feel:  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- If I only choose **one dish**, I feel:  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**5. Sketch the “enjoyment curve”**

Without math, draw a rough graph of:

- Amount of food eaten  
- Overall enjoyment  

Your curve should show:


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**6. Qualitatively find the “optimal plate”**

Using reasoning only:

- Which foods give **high enjoyment per bite**?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Which foods give **low enjoyment per bite**?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Which foods fill you up fastest (stuffing, rolls)?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

- Which foods give you enjoyment *without* making you too full (cranberry sauce, green beans)?  
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now describe your **optimal combination** in words:

## Optimization Case Studies

**Case Study 1 — Optimal Nutrient Input for Algal Growth (Unconstrained)**

In a controlled lake experiment, researchers add a nutrient solution (nitrogen + phosphorus mix) at rate \(x\) grams per day.  
For small additions, algae grow rapidly.  
But after a point, adding more nutrients leads to self-shading and oxygen depletion, which reduce productivity.

A simple model for **daily algal biomass produced** (in grams) is:

\[
G(x) = 15x - 0.3x^2.
\]

This model has no constraints: any non-negative \(x\) is allowed in the experimental design.

---

**Your Tasks**

**1. Understand the model**  
a) What is the decision variable?  
b) What is the objective?  
c) Is this a maximization or a minimization problem?

---

**2. Find the optimum**  
Compute the derivative:

\[
G'(x) = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

Find the critical point(s) by solving:

\[
G'(x) = 0.
\]

Critical point(s):  
\[
x = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

---

**3. Classify the critical point**

Use one of the following:

- First derivative sign chart  
- Second derivative test  

Second derivative:  
\[
G''(x) = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

Is the critical point a:
- local maximum?  
- local minimum?  
- neither?

Explain your reasoning:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**4. Interpret the result**

1. What nutrient level \(x\) gives maximum algal growth?  
2. Plug it into \(G(x)\) to compute the maximum biomass.  

\[
G(x^{*}) = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

3. In ecological terms, why does productivity eventually decline at high nutrient levels?

**Case Study 2 — Optimal Light Intensity for Photosynthesis (Unconstrained)**

In a greenhouse experiment, researchers control the intensity of artificial light reaching a plant canopy.  
At low light levels, photosynthesis increases rapidly.  
At high light levels, enzymes saturate and heat stress reduces efficiency.

A simple model for **photosynthetic rate** (in µmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) as a function of light intensity \(I\) (in arbitrary light units) is:

\[
P(I) = 40I - 0.5I^2.
\]

There are no constraints on the light intensity: the researchers can set \(I\) to any non-negative value.

**Your Tasks**

**1. Understand the model**  
a) What is the decision variable?  
b) What is the objective?  
c) Is this a maximization or minimization problem?

---

**2. Find the optimum**  
Compute the derivative:

\[
P'(I) = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

Find the critical point(s) by solving:

\[
P'(I) = 0.
\]

Critical point(s):  
\[
I = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

---

**3. Classify the critical point**

Use either:

- First derivative sign chart  
- Second derivative test  

Second derivative:  
\[
P''(I) = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

Is the critical point a:

- local maximum?  
- local minimum?  
- neither?

Explain your reasoning:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**4. Interpret the result**

1. What light intensity \(I\) gives the **maximum photosynthetic rate**?  
2. Compute the maximum value:

\[
P(I^\*) = \quad\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
\]

3. Ecologically, why does photosynthesis decline when light becomes too intense?

Let

- \(x\) = length of one side of the square base  
- \(H\) = height of the container  


Your goal is to build the container with the **maximum possible volume**

**🚩 Lifeguard Optimization Problem — Rescue Path Minimization**

A lifeguard stands **on the shoreline** at point **A**.  
A swimmer is in distress **100 meters down the beach** and **100 meters offshore** at point **B**.

The lifeguard can:

## Activity: Which Shape Maximizes Volume When Surface Area = 100? {-}

You are designing a container for an environmental monitoring project.  
You have exactly **100 units²** of construction material.  
Your goal is to determine **which shape produces the maximum possible volume** using that fixed surface area.

You will compare three shapes:

1. **Sphere**  
2. **Closed Cylinder** (top and bottom included)  
3. **Rectangular Prism** with a **square base**

Work through each part, then compare your results at the end.

---

### Part 1 — Sphere {-}

A sphere of radius \(r\) has:

\[
A = 4\pi r^2 = 100,
\qquad 
V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3.
\]

**Tasks**

1. Solve for \(r\).  
2. Compute the volume.

<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

**Surface area**

\[
4\pi r^2 = 100
\Rightarrow
r = \frac{5}{\sqrt{\pi}}.
\]

**Volume**

\[
V = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{5}{\sqrt{\pi}}\right)^3
= \frac{500}{3\sqrt{\pi}}
\approx 94.1.
\]

</details>

---

### Part 2 — Cylinder {-}

A cylinder with radius \(r\) and height \(h\) has:

\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h = 100, 
\qquad
V = \pi r^2 h.
\]

**Tasks**

1. Solve the surface-area constraint for \(h\).  
2. Substitute into \(V\).  
3. Optimize to find \(r\) and \(h\).  
4. Compute the max volume.

<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

**Constraint**

\[
h = \frac{100 - 2\pi r^2}{2\pi r}.
\]

**Volume**

\[
V(r)=50r - \pi r^3.
\]

**Derivative**

\[
V'(r)=50 - 3\pi r^2 = 0
\Rightarrow
r=\sqrt{\frac{50}{3\pi}}\approx 2.304.
\]

**Height**

\[
h=\frac{100}{3\pi r} \approx 4.61.
\]

**Volume**

\[
V \approx 76.9.
\]

</details>

---

### Part 3 — Rectangular Prism (s {-}

Let the base be \(x \times x\) and the height be \(h\):

\[
A = 2x^2 + 4xh = 100,
\qquad
V = x^2 h.
\]

**Tasks**

1. Solve the constraint for \(h\).  
2. Substitute into \(V(x)\).  
3. Optimize to find \(x\) and \(h\).  
4. Compute the max volume.

<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

\[
h = \frac{100 - 2x^2}{4x}.
\]

\[
V(x)=25x - \frac{1}{2}x^3.
\]

\[
V'(x)=25 - \frac{3}{2}x^2 = 0
\Rightarrow
x=\sqrt{\frac{50}{3}}\approx 4.083.
\]

\[
h \approx 4.08.
\]

\[
V \approx 68.0.
\]

</details>

---

### Part 4 — Final Comparison {-}

| Shape | Maximum Volume |
|--------|----------------|
| Sphere | **94.1** |
| Cylinder | 76.9 |
| Rectangular Prism | 68.0 |

**Conclusion:**  
The **sphere** gives the largest possible volume for a fixed surface area of 100. This matches the classical result that **a sphere minimizes surface area for a given volume**, or equivalently, **maximizes volume for a given surface area**.
