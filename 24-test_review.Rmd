## Short-Answer Optimization Questions (25 Total)

---

1. **What is the “objective function” in an optimization problem?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
It is the function you want to maximize or minimize—e.g., growth, cost, carbon storage, habitat value.
</details>

---

2. **Why is defining the objective function often the hardest step in real environmental problems?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Because you must decide exactly what you are optimizing and how competing processes (benefits vs. penalties, diminishing returns, constraints) interact mathematically.
</details>

---

3. **How do you find critical points of a differentiable function?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Differentiate the objective function and set the derivative equal to zero; solve for the variable(s).
</details>

---

4. **What does the second derivative tell you about a critical point?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
If \(f''(x)>0\): local minimum.  
If \(f''(x)<0\): local maximum.  
If \(f''(x)=0\): inconclusive.
</details>

---

5. **What should you do if the derivative never equals zero on the domain?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
There are no interior critical points; the optimum must occur at a boundary or the function is monotonic.
</details>

---

6. **What if the derivative equals zero only at a point outside the feasible domain?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
The critical point is thrown out. The optimum must lie at a domain boundary or another feasible critical point.
</details>

---

7. **What should you always check when a problem includes a constraint?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Check whether the unconstrained optimum is feasible. If not, the optimum lies on the boundary.
</details>

---

8. **Why do constrained optimization problems often require evaluating endpoints?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Because constraints restrict the domain; global optima often occur at boundaries, not at interior points.
</details>

---

9. **Why must you convert multivariable problems (with a constraint) into one variable before differentiating?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Because the variables are not independent; substituting the constraint ensures the derivative respects the relationship between variables.
</details>

---

10. **What does it mean if a critical point yields a negative value for a physical quantity (e.g., width, depth)?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
It is physically impossible and must be rejected.
</details>

---

11. **Why can a function have a local maximum that is not the global maximum?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Local maxima only beat nearby values; global maxima require comparing all feasible values, including boundaries.
</details>

---

12. **Give one reason why the optimum might occur at the minimum allowed value of the variable.**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
If the objective decreases as the variable increases, the smallest allowed value gives the best outcome.
</details>

---

13. **Give one reason why the optimum might occur at the maximum allowed value.**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</summary></summary>
If the objective increases with the variable and there is no interior critical point, the endpoint yields the maximum.
</details>

---

14. **A function is always increasing over the domain. Where is the maximum?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
At the right endpoint.
</details>

---

15. **A function is always decreasing over the domain. Where is the minimum?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
At the right endpoint (and maximum at the left endpoint).
</details>

---

16. **Why does concavity simplify optimization?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
If concave down everywhere → any critical point is a global maximum.  
If concave up everywhere → any critical point is a global minimum.
</details>

---

17. **What should you do if the second derivative at a critical point is zero?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Use a first derivative sign chart, higher derivatives, or direct function comparison. The point may be max, min, or neither.
</details>

---

18. **Why must physical context be checked even after math gives a critical point?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Because the mathematically correct point may be unrealistic (negative depth, unsafe height, impossible density, etc.).
</details>

---

19. **How can you tell if the objective function incorrectly models the system?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
If the model predicts impossible or nonsensical optimum values (infinite spacing, negative biomass), the formulation is wrong.
</details>

---

20. **What does it mean if two designs give nearly identical objective values?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
The exact optimum may not matter; choose based on cost, practicality, or robustness. Sensitivity trumps precision.
</details>

---

21. **Why can a local maximum be ecologically meaningless?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
If a larger feasible value exists elsewhere or if the local maximum lies in a biologically irrelevant part of the domain.
</details>

---

22. **In a constrained pond-design problem, why is the shallowest allowed depth sometimes optimal?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Because some models reward surface area more than depth, so minimum depth maximizes habitat or productivity.
</details>

---

23. **Why might an interior critical point be a minimum rather than a maximum?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
Because the second derivative is positive (concave up). The global maximum might lie at a boundary.
</details>

---

24. **Why should you verify your derivative before solving the optimization problem?**  
<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>
A single differentiation error leads to entirely incorrect critical points and interpretations.
</details>

---

25. **What are the three steps for finding a global maximum on a closed interval?**  

<details><summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Find interior critical points.  
- Evaluate the objective at all critical points.  
- Evaluate endpoints and compare all values.

</details>

## Practice: Optimization in Environmental Systems  
Work through the following 10 new problems to deepen your fluency with applied optimization, constraints, and interpretation.

---

### **1. Optimizing Leaf Nitrogen for Maximum Photosynthesis** {-}

Leaf nitrogen concentration \(N\) strongly influences photosynthetic rate, but only up to a point.  
A simplified model:

\[
P(N) = 12N - N^2
\]

where:

- \(N\) = leaf nitrogen (% of dry mass)  
- \(P(N)\) = relative photosynthetic rate  

**Your Task**

1. Find the nitrogen level that maximizes photosynthesis.  
2. Confirm with the second derivative.  
3. Explain why both low and high nitrogen can be suboptimal.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

Differentiate:

\[
P'(N) = 12 - 2N.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
12 - 2N = 0 \Rightarrow N = 6.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
P''(N) = -2 < 0.
\]

Thus \(N = 6\%\) maximizes photosynthesis.

**Interpretation:**  
Low nitrogen limits pigment formation; excess nitrogen leads to costly maintenance respiration.  
The model identifies the efficient “sweet spot.”
</details>

---

### **2. Designing a Riparian Buffer Strip for Maximum Nitrate Removal** {-}

A riparian buffer is planted along a stream to reduce nutrient runoff.  
Nitrate removal per meter of stream is modeled as:

\[
R(w) = 20w - 0.4w^2
\]

where \(w\) = buffer width (m).

**Your Task**

1. Find width maximizing nitrate removal.  
2. Confirm it with the second derivative.  
3. Interpret ecologically.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
R'(w) = 20 - 0.8w.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
20 - 0.8w = 0 \Rightarrow w = 25.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
R''(w) = -0.8 < 0 \Rightarrow \text{maximum.}
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Buffers too narrow miss pollutants; buffers too wide add little new plant/soil interface.  
Twenty-five meters maximizes filtration performance.
</details>

---

### **3. Optimizing Grazing Intensity for Meadow Restoration** {-}

Meadow biomass under light grazing increases, but declines under heavy grazing.  
A restoration team models biomass as:

\[
B(g) = 80g - 5g^2,
\]

where \(g\) is grazing intensity (sheep per hectare).

**Your Task**

1. Find the optimal grazing intensity.  
2. Confirm with the second derivative.  
3. Explain how this relates to “intermediate disturbance.”

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
B'(g) = 80 - 10g.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
80 - 10g = 0 \Rightarrow g = 8.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
B''(g) = -10 < 0.
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Very low grazing allows dominance by tall competitors; very high grazing suppresses all vegetation.  
An intermediate level (8 animals/ha) maximizes overall biomass.
</details>

---

### **4. Sizing a Biochar Kiln to Maximize Net Carbon Benefit** {-}

A small biochar kiln processes biomass at rate:

\[
C(s) = 50s - 0.5s^2,
\]

where \(s\) is kiln size (m³) and \(C(s)\) is net carbon benefit per batch.

**Your Task**

1. Find the optimal kiln size.  
2. Use second derivative to confirm.  
3. Explain why both too small and too large kilns are problematic.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
C'(s) = 50 - s.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
50 - s = 0 \Rightarrow s = 50.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
C''(s) = -1 < 0.
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Small kilns underutilize heat; very large kilns lose heat to inefficiency and incomplete pyrolysis.  
A 50 m³ kiln balances throughput and efficiency.
</details>

---

### **5. Solar Farm Layout: Maximize Energy per Unit Land Area** {-}

Panel spacing \(d\) affects shading and reflection losses.  
Energy per panel is modeled as:

\[
E(d) = 200d - 10d^2.
\]

**Your Task**

1. Find spacing that maximizes energy production.  
2. Check with second derivative.  
3. Explain physically.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
E'(d) = 200 - 20d.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
200 - 20d = 0 \Rightarrow d = 10.
\]

\[
E''(d) = -20 < 0.
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Panels too close shade each other; too far wastes land.  
Ten meters gives optimal solar spacing.
</details>

---

### **6. Terraced Hillside Farming: Minimizing Soil Loss** {-}

A farmer designs terrace spacing \(x\) to minimize yearly soil loss:

\[
L(x) = \frac{100}{x} + 0.5x,
\]

where:

- \(\frac{100}{x}\): erosion reduced by closer spacing  
- \(0.5x\): cost of constructing/maintaining terraces

**Your Task**

1. Find \(x\) minimizing soil loss.  
2. Use the second derivative to confirm.  
3. Interpret tradeoffs.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
L'(x) = -\frac{100}{x^2} + 0.5.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
0.5 = \frac{100}{x^2}
\Rightarrow x^2 = 200
\Rightarrow x = \sqrt{200} \approx 14.14.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
L''(x) = \frac{200}{x^3} > 0.
\]

Thus \(x \approx 14.14\) m minimizes soil loss.

**Interpretation:**  
Tight spacing reduces erosion but is expensive; wide spacing saves cost but erodes more.  
The optimum balances erosion control and cost.
</details>

---

### **7. Designing a Wildlife Pond: Maximizing Habitat With a Volume Constraint** {-}

Restoration ecologists are designing a circular wildlife pond to support amphibians, birds, and aquatic plants.  
A pond with a **wide surface** and **moderate depth** provides the best habitat:

- A **larger radius** increases shoreline complexity and warm shallow zones.  
- Excessive **depth** reduces habitat quality, especially for amphibians that rely on shallow, vegetated margins.

Let:

- \(r\): pond radius (m)  
- \(h\): pond depth (m)  

The pond must hold **200 m³** of water:

\[
\pi r^2 h = 200.
\]

Habitat quality is modeled as:

\[
H(r, h) = \pi r^2 - 4h,
\]

where:
- \(\pi r^2\) = habitat value from area  
- \(-4h\) = penalty for depth beyond ideal shallow conditions  

However, ecologists require:

\[
h \ge 0.5 \quad\text{(minimum depth to avoid drying in summer)}.
\]

This creates a **feasible domain** so that a maximum can exist.

---

**Your Task**

1. Use the volume constraint to rewrite \(H\) in one variable.  
2. Find the critical point and classify it.  
3. Determine whether the critical point lies in the feasible region.  
4. Identify the habitat-maximizing radius and depth.  

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

**Step 1: Substitute the volume constraint**

\[
h = \frac{200}{\pi r^2}.
\]

\[
H(r) = \pi r^2 - 4\left(\frac{200}{\pi r^2}\right)
      = \pi r^2 - \frac{800}{\pi r^2}.
\]

---

**Step 2: Differentiate**

\[
H'(r) = 2\pi r - \frac{1600}{\pi r^3}.
\]

Set \(H'(r) = 0\):

\[
2\pi r = \frac{1600}{\pi r^3}.
\]

Multiply both sides by \(\pi r^3\):

\[
2\pi^2 r^4 = 1600.
\]

\[
r^4 = \frac{800}{\pi^2}.
\]

\[
r^* = \left(\frac{800}{\pi^2}\right)^{1/4}.
\]

---

**Step 3: Classify using the second derivative**

Compute:

\[
H''(r) = 2\pi + \frac{4800}{\pi r^4}.
\]

Because both terms are **positive**, we have:

\[
H''(r) > 0 \quad\text{for all } r>0.
\]

Thus the critical point is a **minimum**, not a maximum**.

So the interior point cannot give the maximum habitat.

---

**Step 4: Since interior point is a minimum, the maximum lies on the boundary**

The feasible domain for depth is:

\[
h \ge 0.5.
\]

Use the shallowest allowable depth because shallow ponds maximize habitat:

\[
h^* = 0.5\ \text{m}.
\]

Now use volume constraint to find \(r\):

\[
\pi r^2 (0.5) = 200
\]

\[
r^2 = \frac{400}{\pi}
\]

\[
r^* = \sqrt{\frac{400}{\pi}}
     = \frac{20}{\sqrt{\pi}}
     \approx 11.28\ \text{m}.
\]

---

**Final Optimal Pond Design**

- **Depth:**  
  \[
  h^* = 0.5\ \text{m}
  \]

- **Radius:**  
  \[
  r^* \approx 11.28\ \text{m}
  \]

- **Habitat outcome:**  
  The best pond is **as wide and shallow as permitted**, constrained only by the minimum ecological depth.

---

**Ecological Interpretation**

- Habitat quality is maximized by **broad, shallow ponds**, which support warm littoral zones, high primary productivity, and diverse vegetation structure.  
- The model penalizes depth and rewards area, so the optimum occurs at the **shallowest allowed depth**, not at an interior critical point.  
- Adding the depth constraint makes the problem realistic and yields a true maximum.

### **8. Wind Turbine Height for Maximum Power Output** {-}

A wind turbine’s power output depends on height \(h\) (meters):

\[
P(h) = 20h - 0.2h^2.
\]

**Your Task**

1. Find the optimal turbine height.  
2. Confirm with second derivative.  
3. Explain why turbines cannot just be infinitely tall.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
P'(h) = 20 - 0.4h.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
20 - 0.4h = 0 \Rightarrow h = 50 \text{ m}.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
P''(h) = -0.4 < 0.
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Height increases wind speed, but increased tower mass, bending stresses, and inefficiencies reduce marginal gains.  
Fifty meters is the balance point.
</details>

---

### **9. Coral Reef Restoration: Optimizing Transplant Density** {-}

Transplanted coral fragments grow and fuse into colonies, but overcrowding increases mortality.  
Model:

\[
G(d) = 30d - d^2,
\]

where \(d\) is transplant density (fragments per m²).

**Your Task**

1. Find density maximizing growth.  
2. Confirm with second derivative.  
3. Interpret.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
G'(d) = 30 - 2d.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
30 - 2d = 0 \Rightarrow d = 15.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
G''(d) = -2 < 0.
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Low densities slow reef formation; high densities cause shading and disease.  
Fifteen fragments/m² is optimal.
</details>

---

### **10. Urban Green Roof: Minimizing Stormwater Runoff** {-}

Green roof substrate depth \(z\) affects stormwater retention:

\[
R(z) = 15\sqrt{z} - z.
\]

**Your Task**

1. Find depth maximizing retention.  
2. Use the second derivative test.  
3. Explain sustainability implications.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

\[
R'(z) = \frac{15}{2\sqrt{z}} - 1.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
\frac{15}{2\sqrt{z}} = 1
\Rightarrow \sqrt{z} = \frac{15}{2}
\Rightarrow z = \frac{225}{4} = 56.25.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
R''(z) = -\frac{15}{4}z^{-3/2} < 0.
\]

**Interpretation:**  
Very shallow roofs store little water; very deep ones drain slowly and add weight.  
A depth of 56 cm balances retention and structural load.
</details>

---

### **11. Kelp Forest Restoration: Optimizing Mooring Spacing** {-}

Kelp restoration teams anchor kelp seedlings on ropes suspended from floating buoys.  
If buoys are too close, shading reduces kelp growth; if too far, total canopy area decreases.

Let spacing between buoys be \(d\) meters.  
Kelp canopy productivity per anchor rope is modeled as:

\[
P(d) = 80d - 4d^2.
\]

---

**Your Task**

1. Find the spacing \(d\) that maximizes kelp productivity.  
2. Confirm the result using the second derivative.  
3. Explain the ecological tradeoff shaping this optimum.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

Differentiate:

\[
P'(d) = 80 - 8d.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
80 - 8d = 0 \Rightarrow d = 10.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
P''(d) = -8 < 0,
\]

so **10 m** gives a maximum.

**Interpretation:**  
Very tight spacing creates shading and drag; very wide spacing limits canopy formation.  
A 10-m spacing balances light availability with total canopy area.
</details>

---

### **12. Oyster Reef Design: Maximize Filtration Surface** {-}

A reef restoration team designs reef modules of radius \(r\) (m).  
Surface area available for oyster attachment is:

\[
A(r) = 100r - 2r^2.
\]

This captures:

- increasing habitat with module size, but  
- diminishing efficiency as very large modules reduce water flow inside the reef.

---

**Your Task**

1. Find radius \(r\) maximizing oyster habitat area.  
2. Confirm with second derivative.  
3. Explain why very large modules reduce effectiveness.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

Differentiate:

\[
A'(r) = 100 - 4r.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
100 - 4r = 0 \Rightarrow r = 25.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
A''(r) = -4 < 0.
\]

Thus the maximum occurs at **25 m**.

**Interpretation:**  
Large structures restrict internal circulation, reducing actual usable surface area.  
The optimum balances habitat size with efficient water flow.
</details>

---

### **13. Coral Nursery Lines: Optimizing Fragment Spacing** {-}

Floating coral nurseries suspend corals along horizontal lines.  
Growth per coral fragment is modeled by:

\[
G(s) = 60s - 3s^2,
\]

where \(s\) is spacing (cm).

---

**Your Task**

1. Find the spacing that maximizes coral growth.  
2. Use the second derivative test.  
3. Explain the biological reasoning behind the shape of the model.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

Differentiate:

\[
G'(s) = 60 - 6s.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
60 - 6s = 0 \Rightarrow s = 10.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
G''(s) = -6 < 0.
\]

Thus coral growth is maximized at **10 cm** spacing.

**Interpretation:**  
Close spacing increases competition for light and water flow; wide spacing wastes nursery capacity.  
Ten centimeters provides an efficient density for fragment growth.
</details>

---

### **14. Marine Reserve Ranger Patrol: Minimizing Response Time** {-}

A marine reserve uses a circular island of radius **4 km** as its monitoring base.  
A patrol boat is docked somewhere along a radius, at a distance \(x\) from the center of the island.

The **worst-case response distance** to any point on the circular reserve boundary is modeled by:

\[
T(x) = x + \sqrt{16 - x^2},
\]

where:

- \(x\) = distance from the island center to the dock (km)  
- the term \(\sqrt{16 - x^2}\) is the distance from the dock to the farthest point on the boundary  

The management goal is to **minimize this worst-case response distance**.

---

**Your Task**

1. Differentiate to find any interior critical points.  
2. Classify the critical point using the second derivative.  
3. Identify the dock location \(x\) that **minimizes** the response time.  
4. Explain why boundary locations minimize the maximum distance.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

**Step 1: Differentiate**

\[
T(x) = x + \sqrt{16 - x^2}.
\]

\[
T'(x) = 1 - \frac{x}{\sqrt{16 - x^2}}.
\]

Set \(T'(x) = 0\):

\[
1 = \frac{x}{\sqrt{16 - x^2}}.
\]

Square both sides:

\[
1 = \frac{x^2}{16 - x^2}.
\]

\[
16 - x^2 = x^2
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
x^2 = 8.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

This is the **only interior critical point**.

---

**Step 2: Second derivative**

Compute carefully:

\[
T''(x)
= -\frac{16}{(16 - x^2)^{3/2}}.
\]

Since the denominator is positive on \(0 < x < 4\):

\[
T''(x) < 0,
\]

so the critical point at \(x = 2\sqrt{2}\) is a **local maximum**, not a minimum.

---

**Step 3: Evaluate endpoints to find the minimum**

Feasible domain: \(0 \le x \le 4\).

\[
T(0) = 0 + \sqrt{16} = 4.
\]

\[
T(4) = 4 + 0 = 4.
\]

At the interior critical point:

\[
T(2\sqrt{2})
= 2\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{16 - 8}
= 2\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2}
= 4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.66.
\]

Thus:

- **interior point gives a maximum**
- **minimum occurs at the boundaries**

---

**Final Answer: Optimal Dock Locations**

The worst-case response distance is minimized when the dock is placed at:

- **\(x = 0\)** (island center), or  
- **\(x = 4\)** (island edge)

Both yield:

\[
T = 4\text{ km}.
\]

Any interior location gives a **longer** worst-case response distance.

---

**Interpretation**

- Docking at **center** or **edge** minimizes the maximum distance the patrol boat may need to travel.  
- Any dock placed partway along a radius increases the farthest possible distance, creating a **response-time bottleneck**.  
- This problem illustrates that not all interior critical points are minima—sometimes the **optimal location lies on the boundary** of the feasible region.

### **15. Hatchery Release Strategy: Optimal Smolt Size** {-}

Fish survival after release increases with smolt size \(m\), but hatchery cost and predation during grow-out both increase with size.

Survival benefit:

\[
S(m) = 200m - 5m^2.
\]

- First term: larger smolts survive ocean entry better  
- Second term: diminishing returns and increased accumulation of hatchery cost/risk

---

**Your Task**

1. Find the size \(m\) (grams) maximizing survival benefit.  
2. Confirm with second derivative.  
3. Provide ecological interpretation.

<details>
<summary><strong>Show Solution</strong></summary>

Differentiate:

\[
S'(m) = 200 - 10m.
\]

Set to zero:

\[
200 - 10m = 0 \Rightarrow m = 20\ \text{g}.
\]

Second derivative:

\[
S''(m) = -10 < 0.
\]

Thus **20 g** maximizes survival benefit.

**Interpretation:**  
Fish released too small face marine predation; too large require costly rearing and encounter density-dependent issues in tanks.  
The optimum balances hatchery cost with early marine survival probability.
</details>
